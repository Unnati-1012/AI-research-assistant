None||Overall, three-dimensional (3D) printing is a technology booming

None||In this context, the manufacture of parts layer-by-layer with specific

2||46 3D Printing of Biopolymers
None||3.1 Introduction
None||Since the past decade, tissue engineering has shown a sensational
None||promise in providing more viable alternatives to surgical procedures
None||for harvested tissues, implants, and prostheses. Due to the fast
None||development on biomaterial technologies, it is now possible for
None||doctors to use patients’ cells to repair orthopedic defects such
None||as focal articular cartilage lesions. In order to support the three-
None||dimensional tissue formation, scaff olds made by biocompatible
None||and bioresorbable polymers and composite materials, produced
None||by three-dimensional (3D) printing, for providing temporary
None||support to the damaged body and cell structures have been
None||developed recently. Although ceramic and metallic materials have
None||been widely accepted for the development of implants, their non-
None||resorbability and necessity of second surgical operation result in
None||extra discomfort for the patients and limit their wide applications
None||[1].
None||3D printing is also known as additive manufacturing (AM),
None||layered manufacturing, rapid prototyping (RP), or solid freeform
None||fabrication. This technique represents the direct fabrication of
None||parts layer-by-layer, based on data obtained by computerized
None||medical imaging equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging
None||(MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, using a computer-
None||aided design (CAD) file [2]. In 3D printing, CAD models of the
None||parts to be manufactured are first sliced in a virtual environment
None||to create a stack of two-dimensional (2D) slices. A 3D printing
None||machine then builds the parts one layer at a time based on the 2D
None||slice information, stacking and joining successive layers to make
None||the final 3D object. Just as the Internet has given us the ability
None||to access information and connect with people from diff erent
None||parts of the world, CAD has provided us the ability to create,
None||modify, and, if needed, critique designs in a virtual world. With
None||the advent of 3D printing, such virtual designs can now be
None||rendered into physical 3D objects that can serve as prototypes
None||or be directly used as functional parts for a variety of
None||applications. In this context, polymers in various forms, reactive,
None||liquid solutions or as thermoplastic melts play a key role in many
3||Introduction 47
None||applications and the further expansion toward manufacturing
None||robust, real end use products [3].
None||The origins of contemporary 3D printing can be traced back
None||to the 1980s when Hull invented stereolithography (SLA), the
None||first 3D printing technology [4]. SLA is a process in which an
None||ultraviolet (UV) laser light source is focused onto the surface of a
None||UV-curable liquid monomer bath and scanned in patterns
None||representing slice cross sections. The scanned monomers undergo
None||photo-induced cross-linking and harden to form the desired
None||2D cross sections, while the uncured monomers remain in the
None||bath. Hull was also the first to find a way to allow a CAD file to
None||communicate with the RP system in order to build computer-
None||modeled parts. Hull’s patent was approved in 1986, making it
None||the first patent for a 3D printer. The company 3D Systems,
None||founded by Hull, focused on commercializing SLA systems, which
None||were the first commercial 3D printers [5].
None||Fast forward to 2014, when the U.S. National Aeronautics
None||and Space Administration (NASA) launched the first 3D printing
None||machine to the International Space Station to directly build
None||parts in space under zero gravity [6]. This is also the year
None||when researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory built a
None||complete car body using a 3D printing technique known as big
None||area additive manufacturing and partnered with Local Motors
None||to commission and drive a functional car at the International
None||Manufacturing Technology Show [7]. 3D printing-based
None||agile manufacturing technologies are promoting on-demand
None||production with traditional as well as innovative designs that
None||are difficult, if not impossible, to make through conventional
None||manufacturing (CM) approaches. 3D printing technologies
None||are also making a significant impact in biomedical research—
None||from device designs to tissue engineering (TE) to bioprinting and
None||drug delivery.
None||After following the technology, markets, and publications
None||over several years, it appears that now we are in a period where
None||many decisive actors in industry, media, and research and even
None||finance advisors realize that the traditional area of prototyping
None||is expanding more and more into manufacturing, and this will
None||have a significant impact on many areas of our lives, and probably
None||a spectacular growth of the 3D printing industry [3].
4||48 3D Printing of Biopolymers
None||3.2 Brief History of 3D Printing
None||Several 3D printing technologies were conceived and developed
None||around the time of the emergence of SLA. Deckard invented
None||selective laser sintering (SLS) as a graduate student in Beaman’s
None||group at the University of Texas at Austin [8]. SLS uses powder
None||materials spread on a build plate where a laser selectively
None||sinters the powder in certain areas based on the CAD file [6]. A
None||similar powder bed-based concept formed the basis of another
None||technology, 3D printing, at the Massachusetts Institute of
None||Technology by Sachs’ group. Inkjet printing was combined with
None||a powder bed, where a binder was printed onto each successive
None||layer of swept powder based on the CAD slice information.
None||Using this approach, complex shaped metal, polymer, and ceramic
None||parts could be printed. However, post-processing or sintering
None||steps were often required to enhance the final strength of the
None||parts [9]. Scott and Lisa Crump developed another 3D printing
None||technology called fused deposition modeling (FDM). FDM
None||involves heating a thermoplastic filament to a semi-liquid state,
None||which is then extruded and deposited through a nozzle onto
None||a substrate to build parts layer-by-layer based on the CAD file
None||information [10, 11]. Additionally, Sanders released the first
None||3D printer based on inkjet printing of thermoplastic polymers
None||[12]. Parts with fine features could be made easily using this
None||approach. These are some of the notable early-stage 3D
None||printing technologies that were primarily focused on RP for design
None||verification and visualization.
None||Over the past 15 years, a variety of new technologies have
None||evolved that have transformed the idea of RP to AM, where parts
None||produced by a 3D printer can be directly used for a variety of
None||applications. In the case of metallic materials, laser-based or
None||electron beam-based technologies with or without a powder
None||bed have truly revolutionized industrial applications of these
None||printers. For biomedical applications, novel fabrication
None||approaches based on the 3D-Bioplotter or direct ink writing,
None||laser-assisted bioprinting, and robotic-assisted printing are all
None||in use for diff erent applications. Table 3.1 off ers a brief summary
None||of some of these technologies that are relevant for biomaterials
None||and their applications toward TE [13–26]. Other technologies
None||related to metallic printing are covered throughout this chapter.

8||52 3D Printing of Biopolymers
None||An American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
None||International committee dedicated to the specification of standards
None||for AM was formed in 2009 [27]. This committee, known as ASTM
None||F42, created a categorization of all 3D printing technologies into
None||seven major groups. Table 3.2 shows the major categories along
None||with the well-known 3D printing technologies that fit within
None||each category.

None||3.3 3D Materials Processing Techniques
None||In general, there are two modes of processing 3D materials: the
None||extrusion mode and the droplet mode. In the extrusion mode,
9||3D Materials Processing Techniques 53
None||the material is extruded out of the nozzle tip under an applied
None||pressure. This mode can basically lay down the material in the
None||form of line structures to create the desired model by moving the
None||nozzle tip over a substrate in the designed path. This process can
None||be repeated layer by layer to develop a freeform fabricated part.
None||In the droplet mode, the material is deposited in the form of
None||droplets that is controlled by using a frequency function and key
None||parameters in the nozzle system settings. The droplet mode can
None||form a structured layer by depositing multiple droplets at desired
None||locations on a substrate. Similarly, this process can be repeated
None||to fabricate a 3D structure. Figure 3.1 shows a schematic diagram
None||of the extrusion and droplet mode for the deposition.

None||Each nozzle system is unique in its method of operation,

None||However, the detailed setup for each system is diff erent and the
None||material delivery system parameters such as air pressure are not
None||controlled by in-house software. Characteristics and comparison
None||of the four nozzle systems with their advantages and limitations
None||is shown in Table 3.3.

11||3D Materials Processing Techniques 55
None||More specifically, these methods of processing 3D materials
None||can be divided into two distinct groups based on the step, which
None||defines the shape of each cross section.
None||As a summary, the first group can be described as a repetitive
None||process of the following:
None||(i) Apply a “fluid” material as a thin layer on a workpiece (or
None||fluid bed) under construction.
None||(ii) Induce a selective phase change (solidification) on the
None||current cross section of the work piece.
None||(iii) Lower the work piece (on a platform) into the fluid bed by
None||one layer thickness; then repeat.
None||The second group combines the “imaging” step with the
None||addition of the material of a full cross section:
None||(i) Dispense a liquid or liquefied material as small droplets or
None||filament onto the preceding cross section of the work piece.
None||(ii) Solidify the new cross section.
None||(iii) Optionally equalize the new layer to a defined thickness;
None||then repeat.
None||A third group is the group of “imaging” on a bulk material
None||that uses a (ink) jet technology on a powder bed (ASTM: Binder
None||Jetting) to solidify the loose powder with a liquid solution,
None||which dries or reacts to agglomerate the powder particles at the
None||specified locations of each layer. This method was originally
None||coined with the name “3D printing” by the MIT, but is now used
None||alongside the other techniques with the same designation.
None||If we look at the second group of technologies where we
None||use addition of the material for each full cross section, without
None||a separate imaging step, we have two major processes, which
None||dominate the market by machine numbers: (Multi)jet printing
None||of reactive resins or molten wax (ASTM: Material Jetting) and
None||extrusion of molten thermoplastics (ASTM: Material Extrusion).
None||The processes coined as Multijet Modelling or Polyjet use a
None||print head similar to inkjet printers to deposit exactly shaped
None||layers of a photopolymer resin, and normally a support material
None||to partially surround it, which is then immediately cured with a UV
None||lamp. In order to maintain exact layer thickness and compensate
None||for small variations of droplet size, current machines use a
12||56 3D Printing of Biopolymers
None||mechanical planarizer, which removes excess material on each
None||pass of the print head.
None||These machines can process robust resin objects—generally
None||complex acrylate formulations—with high accuracy and
None||resolution, and do not require complex lasers and beam scanners.
None||Some limitations related to materials relate to the viscosity
None||requirements of the jetting process; often the viscosity is reduced
None||by heating the print head and nozzle plate. This heating is also
None||required in machines, which are processing wax materials to
None||produce patterns for investment casting, in jewelry and dental
None||restorations applications notably.
None||A recent development adds machines with multiple print
None||heads or channels, again similar to color inkjet printers, which
None||can deposit selected mixtures of diff erent materials. Besides
None||a palette of colors, this also allows to assign diff erent material
None||properties, essentially modulus of elasticity, to diff erent regions
None||of a part. It is another step to replace assemblies of several
None||components and fasteners with a single part, which is generally
None||an advantage of additive technologies.
None||The last technique we look at is based on the original
None||process of FDM and also relies on a rather simple buildup of an
None||essentially standard thermoplastic material (ASTM: Material
None||Extrusion). The concept of melting a “standard” plastic material
None||and extruding it through a thin, heated nozzle seems quite
None||straightforward; the extruded melt can then be spread in a
None||controlled X-Y-movement onto the previous layer of part being
None||built. Obviously, the processing temperature has to be adapted to
None||the specific material and well controlled, and thermal shrinkage
None||after deposition can be reduced by heating the build platform
None||or even the complete build chamber.
None||Originally developed and implemented as an industrial quality
None||process with larger size machines and a selection of thermoplastic
None||polymers, the scope has now grown into the widest palette of
None||smaller and low-cost machines. Some of these machines are even
None||off ered as kits to be built or assembled by the user. Recently,
None||this type of machines have become very popular and also have
None||the largest number manufacturers of quite similar devices, mostly
None||with rather small build volumes of roughly 100 to 200 mm on
None||each side. While the simple machines just have one extrusion
None||head and filament spool, many of the newer developments have
13||3D Materials Processing Techniques 57
None||multiple heads and can extrude support and part material for
None||good accuracy and complex shapes, or to combine diff erent
None||colors in a single part.
None||The most popular polymers in this process are ABS and
None||poly lactide, which is also off ered on almost every entry-level
None||printer, but higher-grade machines can also process engineering
None||materials such as polycarbonate, polyamide, or even polyphenyl
None||sulfone. As the starting material in this process already is a
None||thermoplastic polymer, the mechanical properties of parts
None||approach those of traditionally molded or machined products,
None||similar to SLS, but using a significantly simpler machine.
None||The extrusion-type machines are a specific example that
None||demonstrate the accelerated progress in the development toward
None||the wide availability of 3D printers at aff ordable cost, relying
None||on the assembly of readily available core components such as
None||precision rails, servo drives, control electronics modules, including
None||computers and software that can handle the complex geometry
None||data. The latter is also essential for the design of the 3D model
None||data based on CAD programs or object scanners; not the least is
None||the declining cost of computers to handle all these data and
None||control the machine components.
None||Another early method that uses paper or other thin films
None||of material, which are stacked up, bonded together, and cut to
None||shape was called layered object manufacturing (LOM) and has
None||now been revived (ASTM: Sheet Lamination) with the possibility
None||to use standard office paper sheets. Whereas the original
None||version used an IR laser to cut the individual layers, the more
None||recent devices cut the paper with a stencil, and a special option
None||allows printing onto the sheets with an office printer, which
None||then creates fully colored parts. Whereas paper is a well-known
None||standard build material, the pressure- or heat-sensitive adhesives
None||which hold the sheets together are specially developed to fit the
None||process.
None||It has been observed that a vast choice of 3D printing
None||methods is available, many with a variety of materials to choose
None||from, and generally a large range of possible or preferred
None||applications. Technically the possibilities are almost without
None||limits, and on top of the thousands of applications that are
None||being realized today, there is also a lot of speculation about the
None||imminent replacement of current production technologies with
14||58 3D Printing of Biopolymers
None||these new 3D printers. In reality, the majority of users still apply
None||these methods to produce prototypes of all kinds, unique parts
None||and new designs, including architectural models and display
None||objects. There are quite some areas where 3D printing is
None||competitive with the cost and speed required for a specific set
None||of products, and the available materials meet specifications.
None||Today these applications are mostly in the medical field for
None||personalized prostheses, in the aeronautical business for low-
None||volume production of special parts, or complex-shaped tools
None||and fixtures for traditional manufacturing. The benefits are
None||particularly high for complex parts, which can often replace an
None||assembled device with a single print. The user community is
None||constantly expanding the limits toward manufacturing by 3D
None||printing, and with progress on the machine side, improved
None||reliability, build speed, and intuitive user interfaces, the range
None||of these applications keeps growing steadily. Besides that eff ort,
None||there is a lot of development in materials to expand the scope of
None||manufacturing, notably by the machine manufacturers, independent
None||materials supply companies and at research institutions.
None||This quest for better materials is also true in the realm of
None||low-cost printers, which are aff ordable for individuals and schools
None||at higher levels; hobby designers, artists, and researchers can
None||turn their ideas and creations into solid plastic parts. There
None||is notable interest in creating toys, accessories for personal
None||electronics or sometimes even replacements for broken parts.
None||3.4 Biopolymers Used for 3D Printing
None||Diff erent biopolymers have been studied as materials for the
None||development of devices printed in 3D to be used in medical
None||applications, such as chitosan, alginate, and collagen, among others
None||[2, 28]. Other than biopolymers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),
None||poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly-
None||L-lactide acid (PLLA) are the widely used synthetic polymers in
None||the biomedical field [29].
None||However, not all polymeric materials are applicable and
None||suitable for all manufacturing methods. For example, molding
None||methods are inappropriate for developing medical implants from
15||Biopolymers Used for 3D Printing 59
None||hydrogels. Because, the biomaterial cannot be removed without
None||damaging both internal and external architecture, which will
None||most likely cause the implant breakage [29].
None||Another factor to consider is the degradation rate of the
None||biomaterial, since it is desired that the material degrade once its
None||function is accomplished, which would avoid a second operation
None||on the individuals to remove the implant. In this context, the
None||biodegradation rate of PLLA is too low to match the tissue
None||regeneration process after implantation. Besides, the acidic
None||degradation products of PLLA, such as lactic acid, tend to cause
None||aseptic inflammation in tissue [29]. On the contrary, PCL has the
None||presence of hydrolytic aliphatic–ester bonds, which are unstable.
None||Therefore, its degradation duration can be as long as 24 months
None||for being completely degraded. Thus, PCL is always used to co-
None||polymerize with other materials to have desired degradation
None||properties [1]. So, PCL has a better degradation rate to make
None||long-term implants and controlled-drug-release implants. In this
None||sense, Honda et al. [30] used poly(L-lactide-ε-caprolactone) as a
None||biodegradable sponge and implanted it into a nude mice. After a
None||4-week experimental process, the result showed that there was
None||the formation of cartilage-like structures in the construct [1].
None||Additionally, polymers can be chemically modified to match
None||the rate of tissue regeneration and degradation rate of the
None||material as well as to obtain a wide range of properties for
None||biomedical applications, such as mechanical properties, diff usivity,
None||density, and hydrophilicity. In addition, these may have optimal
None||control over specific cellular interactions with the polymer
None||material, whereby cells are comfortable, interacting with
None||proteins that bind to the surface of the material, particularly
None||biopolymers [29].
None||On the other hand, the combination of more than one
None||biomaterial provides better characteristics than any single type
None||of biomaterial, which in turn leads to the development of
None||composite polymeric materials [29]. In this context, composite
None||polymers as 3D printing materials have been used to improve
None||implant–tissue biocompatibility, i.e., they will not be rejected by
None||the body upon implantation [2]. For example, Inzana et al. [31]
None||developed osseous implants from polymer blends of collagen
None||and Tween 80 using calcium phosphate as a natural filler with
16||60 3D Printing of Biopolymers
None||the aim of improving osteointegration and improving the
None||mechanical properties of the implant [31]. However, the
None||development of these materials requires high temperatures
None||that prevent the incorporation of bioactive molecules and drugs
None||during the 3D printing process, which could stimulate bone
None||regeneration or combat infections [31].
None||The feasibility of 3D printing of composite biopolymers at
None||low temperature has also been demonstrated from low-melting-
None||point matrices [2, 31]. This has allowed the incorporation of drugs,
None||cells, and 3D printing of synthetic or biological polymers such as
None||collagen, thus allowing the development of bioactive implants
None||[2]. Type I collagen is the most abundant structural protein in the
None||human body and is a critical component of bone extracellular
None||matrix, where it plays important roles in this mineralized tissue’s
None||strength and toughness. It has been shown that incorporating
None||collagen into mineralized bone cements could enhance their
None||biomechanical properties, as well as their osteoconductive and
None||osteoinductive characteristics. For example, collagen incorporation
None||into hand-mixed calcium phosphate cements has been shown to
None||improve cellular attachment, viability, proliferation, and activity
None||as well as mechanical properties. Advantages of 3D printing over
None||molding or paste injection include patient-specific geometries
None||and controlled spatial patterning of drugs or polymers within the
None||scaff old [31].
None||3.5 Advantages of 3D Printing for Medical
None||Applications
None||3D printing technology off ers significant advantages for medical
None||applications due to the ability to manufacture low-volume or
None||one-of-a-kind parts on-demand based on patient-specific needs.
None||For example, surgical implants are currently manufactured by
None||making a near-net-shape part via forging, casting, or machining
None||operations, followed by specialized surface finishing or treatments
None||for the desired surface, mechanical properties, and aesthetic
None||eff ects, as shown in Fig. 3.2. These operations require expensive
None||tooling; therefore, patient-specific or one-of-a-kind implants are
None||costly and are rarely used. Other challenges such as difficulty in
None||machining of titanium alloys due to high strength, low modulus of
17||Advantages of 3D Printing for Medical Applications 61
None||elasticity, and low thermal conductivity compared with steel
None||makes it more expensive to manufacture patient-specific
None||implants from these materials [32]. Finally, CM technologies can
None||be energy intensive, producing significant amounts of material
None||waste, and are not capable of easily producing implants with
None||functional gradation.
None||3D printing or AM represents a new option for the
None||production of a variety of biomedical devices such as orthopedic
None||implants. Although AM may require final machining, the AM-
None||based approach allows significant flexibility toward manufacturing
None||customized, low-volume, complex implants. Figure 3.2 compares
None||CM of implants with AM. AM provides geometrical freedom to
None||designers without manufacturing constraints, leading to novel
None||lightweight designs and potentially reduced part counts for
None||medical implants. Specifically for medical implants, AM allows for
None||customized complex shaped functional implants and demand-
None||based manufacturing—which can off er a significant reduction in
None||cost and inventory. Since AM does not require any part specific
None||tooling, cost per part remains constant for AM. However, for
None||CM, there is always a fixed cost for tooling and dies, and therefore,
None||cost per part decreases as the volume of parts increases until
None||it reaches a minimum. Such cost analysis forms the basis and
None||rationale for the use of 3D printing or AM for biomedical devices.
None||Despite some noteworthy success, the construction of human
None||tissue or entire organs with 3D printing or AM continues to present
None||significant challenges [33–36]. From plastic surgery to cancer
None||treatment and from treatment of birth defects to prosthetics
None||for amputees—all areas of medicine are seeking breakthroughs
None||enabled by 3D printing to enhance quality of life or to help patients
None||live longer.
None||We present two examples that illustrate future possibilities.
None||Complex craniofacial titanium implants from computed tomography
None||images of a fractured skull, shown in Fig. 3.3, can be fabricated
None||directly using a laser-based AM technology, Laser Engineered
None||Net Shaping. In another example, shown in Fig. 3.4, TE scaff olds
None||for bone regeneration can be produced through SLS of
None||poly(caprolactone), a biocompatible and bioresorbable polymer,
None||and poly(caprolactone)–hydroxyapatite composites [37, 38].
None||Furthermore, the scaff olds can be produced with a priori
None||designed mechanical properties to match the desired mechanical
None||performance of the target bone tissue.

None||It is envisioned that application of 3D printing will
None||revolutionize the field of biomedical devices and TE due to its
None||inherent flexibility in manufacturing complex parts using various
None||materials. However, many challenges still remain, due to a lack
20||64 3D Printing of Biopolymers
None||of diff erent materials for use in any printer and the inability
None||to manufacture multicomponent structures using commercial
None||printers.
None||3.6 Current Challenges in 3D Printing of
None||Biomaterials
None||3.6.1 Achieving Target Material Properties and
None||Desired Architectures
None||By virtue of layer-by-layer additive fabrication, it is claimed that
None||3D printing provides “complexity for free,” allowing the physical
None||realization of complex 3D structures endowed with complex
None||internal and external architectures. However, every layer and
None||every interface between adjacent layers provides the opportunity
None||for the introduction of defects during 3D printing that can lead
None||to the failure of the part under the intended application conditions.
None||Some of the key challenges associated with 3D printing of
None||biomedical implants lie in achieving target mechanical properties,
None||durability, and designed architectures to satisfy both mechanical
None||and functional requirements. This is especially important in
None||load-bearing implants, where mechanical performance and
None||fatigue are critical. 3D printing technologies are being used to
None||produce permanent implants in metals, polymers, and ceramics.
None||The capabilities of these technologies in processing feedstock
None||materials such as titanium, poly(ether ether ketone), and
None||hydroxyapatite need to be well-characterized and documented
None||under diverse conditions both in vitro and in vivo.
None||The challenges increase when the implants are endowed
None||with intentionally designed or manufacturing-induced porous
None||architectures. The eff ective mechanical properties and failure
None||modes of such porous architectures need to be well understood
None||and integrated into implant design procedures to avoid
None||undesirable implant failure outcomes. Computational design
None||techniques validated with experimentally measured property
None||data need to be integrated into implant design procedures.
None||Additional challenges lie in the ability of 3D printing technologies
21||Current Challenges in 3D Printing of Biomaterials 65
None||to accurately produce desired porous architectures meeting
None||design intent. Often, the length scales associated with the
None||designed porous architectures (ranging from tens to hundreds of
None||microns) are beyond the resolution capability of the 3D printing
None||technology in use.
None||Finally, surface finish or surface roughness can be a critical
None||requirement as well. The inherent stair-stepped surface finish
None||from layer-by-layer fabrication or other material consolidation-
None||induced surface roughness artifacts prevalent in 3D printing are
None||often beneficial for cell anchoring, proliferation, and integration,
None||but in other cases, they can be highly detrimental due to the
None||inducement of foreign body reactions or due to the release of
None||particles into regions surrounding the implant. Thus, careful
None||attention has to be paid to understanding surface finish and
None||surface texture requirements as well as choosing appropriate
None||post-processing procedures to attain final desired surfaces in
None||biomaterials fabricated by 3D printing.
None||3.6.2 Clean and Sterile Manufacturing Environments
None||3D-printed biomaterials are being produced with the intention
None||of use in implants or in laboratory scale studies in bioengineering.
None||In either case, careful attention needs to be paid to the conditions
None||under which the feedstock material is produced, supplied,
None||processed, post-processed, and handled. The scale-up of 3D
None||printing technologies for biomaterials will require careful design
None||of clean manufacturing environments both inside and outside
None||the 3D printing platforms to ensure the avoidance of material
None||contamination and related possible infections. Thus, the design
None||of 3D printing equipment for biomaterials needs to ensure
None||that equipment subsystems can meet the requirements for
None||contamination control, perhaps similar to or even more stringent
None||than those applied in the medical device industry. Furthermore,
None||clean manufacturing environments will need to be designed
None||from the ground up for scale-up manufacturing of 3D-printed
None||biomaterials. New sterilization, packaging, and shipping
None||procedures for 3D-printed biomaterials need to be developed
None||to ensure product integrity at the point of use.
22||66 3D Printing of Biopolymers
None||3.6.3 Concerns Related to Regulatory Issues
None||Regulatory issues are specific to a particular country and should
None||be checked for that particular region first. In the United States,
None||medical devices are classified under three categories based on
None||the risk to the patient: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Class I devices
None||are typically the lowest risk (e.g., a tongue depressor). If there is a
None||predicate device, then many devices are classified under Class II,
None||where the new device is substantially equivalent to the previous
None||device, which has already been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug
None||Administration. Regulatory paths for the Class III or high-risk
None||devices are quite challenging as well as time-consuming. In most
None||cases, regulation follows technology development, and therefore,
None||many times there is a lag in appropriate regulations for certain
None||types of devices.
None||This is the case for 3D printing and its applications to human
None||health. Although the technology for patient-specific implants
None||is available, no clear regulatory path is established toward
None||immediate utilization of this technology. This is also because
None||the risk associated with the use of this technology is yet to
None||be fully understood and evaluated. A TE graft with tailored
None||porosity and chemistry can be fabricated in hours; however, the
None||scientific factors that need to be verified to confirm that this will
None||perform the same way as before are still evolving. Moreover,
None||the advent of diff erent 3D printing technologies is also making
None||this evaluation more complex. Finally, the needs of specific
None||patients are diff erent. A clear understanding of the biomechanical
None||and biological issues for diff erent parts will eventually help
None||develop regulatory pathways for diverse clinical applications
None||of 3D-printed parts. A logical approach will establish regulatory
None||paths for low-risk devices, such as specialty surgical tools, and
None||then slowly move toward the high-risk devices such as
None||patient-matched implants. It is envisioned that such trends will
None||follow in the coming years in the United States as well as other
None||parts of the world.
None||3.6.4 Material-Specific Machines
None||Unlike CM processes such as forging or investment casting,
None||many 3D printing processes are diff erent in terms of the materials
None||that can be used and the delivery of materials. For example,
23||Current Challenges in 3D Printing of Biomaterials 67
None||a polymer-based 3D printing process will not work for metals or
None||ceramics and vice versa. This makes process optimization very
None||important for diff erent materials that will be used with a specific
None||printer. The user must know what material will be used and
None||what kind of resolution is needed before selecting a 3D printer.
None||This limitation is the main reason why diff erent companies have
None||multiple 3D printers for a variety of applications.
None||3.6.5 Future Trends
None||3D printing of multi-material structures is one of the most
None||promising future trends. Diff erent materials at diff erent locations
None||in a structure can off er properties that cannot be achieved using
None||monolithic structures. These materials can only be bonded to
None||each other or alloyed during the part building, allowing for
None||compositional variations in the part. For 3D-printed biomaterials,
None||a simple example can help us understand the power of multi-
None||material 3D printing. For total hip prosthesis, implants are made
None||with either Ti Al V or CoCrMo alloys. To enhance bone–tissue
None||6 4
None||integration, implants are sometimes coated with porous Ti or Ta
None||metal or calcium phosphate-based ceramics. However, diff erent
None||processing strategies are utilized for the addition of coatings.
None||Using multi-material 3D printing, a calcium phosphate or metal
None||coated hip stem can be directly manufactured from the same
None||machine that can also produce an uncoated sample in the very next
None||run. Therefore, in addition to flexibility in design modifications,
None||the potential of incorporating compositional variations will allow
None||future innovations in advanced materials and structures using
None||3D printing.
None||For bioprinting, multi-material structures include cells that
None||can be printed along with organic or inorganic materials to
None||make a fully functional scaff old for TE [39]. Such an approach is
None||gaining considerable attention from a number of researchers,
None||though there are many challenges that need careful attention.
None||For example, cell viability will be key for successful bioprinting
None||operation. Shelf-life of materials with and without cells is
None||another significant issue. Also, due to significant variation in the
None||stiff ness of the cells and materials to be deposited, careful process
None||optimization is necessary to build scaff olds that can be used for
None||further in vitro or in vivo analysis.
24||68 3D Printing of Biopolymers
None||Another important criterion is vascularization or new blood
None||vessel network formation, commonly known as angiogenesis.
None||Figure 3.5 shows new blood vessel formation in 3D-printed-doped
None||tricalcium phosphate TE scaff olds in a rat distal femur model.
None||3D-printed TE scaff olds should support angiogenesis for
None||functional tissue formation to enhance healing in vivo [40–46].
None||Figure 3.5 New blood vessel formation in 3D-printed-doped tricalcium
None||phosphate TE scaff olds implanted in a rat distal femur model.
None||Finally, 3D printing combined with drug or protein delivery
None||is becoming popular and is expected to gain more attention in
None||the future. Drug-/protein-loaded biomaterials with a controlled
None||delivery option can be used to treat many diseases [45]. In particular,
None||specific drug combinations that are patient-matched and unique
None||can be loaded into a single 3D-printed drug delivery device.
None||However, drug–material and drug–drug interactions during 3D
None||printing are complex topics and will require significant process
None||optimization before actual applications can be realized and
None||approved for patient use.
None||3.7 Conclusion
None||The processing of biopolymers and polymer composites through
None||three-dimensional (3D) printing has been gaining a lot of
None||attention, because of its multiple applications in a wide variety
25||References 69
None||of industries. In fact, the exploration of the areas of applicability
None||of this technique remains an active area of research. With the
None||latest 3D printers capable of printing materials with a widely
None||contrasting mechanical behavior and with complex geometries
None||at micrometer resolutions, the potential of this technology
None||has grown. This technology now off ers the possibility of creating
None||complex topologies with fine features, composed of a multitude
None||of materials with variable mechanical properties on a large
None||scale, thus allowing the manufacture of devices with an
None||unprecedented multifunctional performance [47, 48]. Particularly
None||in medical applications, in the last decade there has been a growing
None||interest in the development of medical systems with bioactive
None||properties, which have been possible thanks to the technological
None||development of 3D printing as well as biopolymers, drugs,
None||natural fillers and implementation in vitro or in vivo of cells in
None||the formulated materials, which have generated a series of
None||implants with outstanding mechanical properties and exceptional
None||biocompatibility, adjusted to the exact dimensions of each implant
None||for each patient. Likewise, because of the greater surface area
None||of these devices, the cells are able to regenerate the tissues at
None||a faster rate, thus allowing the patients to recover quickly, and
None||avoiding a subsequent operation to remove the implant, since
None||these implants are degraded in the time, while this one fulfills
None||the mission for which it was developed. Finally, this type of
None||implant also promises to be a controlled-drug-release device,
None||while the polymer material used is degraded.
