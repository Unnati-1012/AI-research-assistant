1||1. Introduction
1||Tissue engineering is fundamentally described as the generation of three- dimensional (3D)
1||artificial tissues. Its consequential task is to regenerate human tissue or to develop cell-based
1||substitutes in order to restore, reconstruct or improve tissue functions (Pörtner et al., 2005;
1||Ellis, 2005). Proper processing of biological and mechanical functionality is monumental for
1||tissue engineered structures, the ones which are not mainly sufficient enough yet. Acquiring
1||the solution for this problem demands intensive researches and studies in every aspects and
1||steps of TE (Sengers et al., 2007). As a matter of fact, creating a functional tissue requires
1||efficient growth of various types of cells on a 3D scaffolds and the bulk production of one
1||cell seems not to be adequate (Ellis et al., 2005).
1||The principal function of a scaffold is to direct cell behavior such as migration, proliferation,
1||differentiation, maintenance of phenotype, and apoptosis by facilitating sensing and
1||responding to the environment via cell–matrix and cell–cell communications (Tabesh et al.,
1||2009). Therefore, having such abilities provides scaffolds seeded with a special type of cell as
1||an important part of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The scaffold design and
1||fabrication are major areas of biomaterial research, since biomaterial scaffold can create
1||substrate within which cells are instructed to form a tissue or an organ in a highly controlled
1||way. In this chapter, it is tried to provide an inclusive survey of biopolymers to be used as
1||scaffolds for tissue engineering, fabrication methods and engineering challenges such as
1||mass transfer and mechanical strength. In the proceeding, these factors are reviewed in
1||vascular and nerve systems.
1||2. Scaffold considerations
1||2.1 Requirements of appropriate scaffold materials for tissue engineering
1||Scaffold design and fabrication are major areas of biomaterial research and they are also
1||important areas for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine research. Scaffold
1||provides the necessary support for cells to proliferate and maintain their differentiated
1||functions, and its architecture defines the ultimate shape of a new organ.
1||An ideal scaffold should possess the following characteristics to bring about the desired
1||biological response (1) the scaffold should possess inter-connecting pores of appropriate
2||154 Biomaterials Science and Engineering
2||scale to favor tissue integration and vascularization, (2) be made from material with
2||controlled biodegradability or bio-resorbability, (3) appropriate surface chemistry to favor
2||cellular attachment, differentiation and proliferation, (4) possess adequate mechanical
2||properties to match the intended site of implantation and handling, (5) should not induce
2||any adverse response and, (6) be easily fabricated into a variety of shapes and sizes (Liu et
2||al., 2007; Sachlos et al., 2003).
2||Due to control scaffold degradation and mechanical integrity, cell-scaffold interaction as
2||well as cell functon, one must have access to a range of materials. Therefore, an appropriate
2||fabrication method is required with which it is possible to have a structure with different
2||independent parameters and materials (Yarlagadda et al., 2005).
2||It is worth to mention that degradation of synthetic polymers, both in vitro and in vivo
2||conditions, releases by-products. For example, for PLLA releasing Lactic acid during
2||degradation, causes reducing the pH, which further accelerates the degradation rate due to
2||autocatalysis which later affects cellular function. (Sachlos & Czernuszka, 2003, as cited
2||Reed and Gilding, 1981)
2||In addition to degradation rate and by-products, certain physical characteristics of the
2||scaffolds must be considered when designing a substrate to be used in tissue engineering
2||applications. For instance, in order to allow proper cell attachment, the scaffold must have a
2||large surface area which can be achieved by creating a highly porous polymeric foam. In
2||these foams, the pore size should be large enough to allow cells to penetrate through the
2||pores, to maximize nutrient and oxygen diffusion, interstitial fluid and blood flow into the
2||interior of the scaffold, to manipulate tissue differentiation (Yarlagadda et al., 2005, as cited
2||Le Huec et al. 1995; Tsuruga et al., 1997). These characteristics (porosity and pore size) often
2||depend on the material and method of scaffold fabrication (Mikos&Temenoff, 2000, as cited
2||Mooney et al., 1999; Nam et al. 2000)
2||2.2 Decent materials for scaffolds fabrication
2||In order to have an effective function, an ideal scaffold must possess the optimum structural
2||parameters, conductivity to the cellular activities leading to neo-tissue formation; these
2||include cell penetration and migration into the scaffold, cell attachment onto the scaffold
2||substrate, cell spreading and proliferation and cell orientation. Such scaffold design
2||parameters are now described with reference to these cellular activities. One of the first
2||considerations when designing a scaffold for tissue engineering is the choice of material.
2||The three main material types which have been successfully investigated to be applied in
2||developing scaffolds include (i) natural polymers, (ii) synthetic polymers, and (iii) ceramics
2||(Willerth & Sakayama-Elbert, 2007; Radulescu et al., 2007).
2||2.2.1 Natural materials
2||Natural polymers commonly derived from protein or carbohydrate polymers have been
2||used as scaffolds for the growth of several tissue types. In the area of tissue engineering, for
2||example, scientists and engineers look for scaffolds on which it may successfully grow cells
2||to replace damaged tissue. Typically, it is desirable for these scaffolds to be: biodegradable,
2||non-toxic/non-inflammatory, mechanically similar to the tissue to be replaced, highly
2||porous, encouragement of cell attachment and growth, easy and cheap to manufacture, and
2||capable of attaching with other molecules (Elmstedt, 2006; Cuy, 2004). Here some examples
2||of natural polymers that have been previously studied for biomaterials application are
2||reviewed.
3||The Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 155
3||- Collagen
3||Collagen is considered by many scientists as an ideal scaffold or matrix for tissue
3||engineering as it is the major protein component of the extracellular matrix. It provides
3||support to connective tissues such as skin, tendons, bones, cartilage, blood vessels, and
3||ligaments in its native environment, and also interacts with cells in connective tissues and
3||transduces essential signals for the regulation of cell anchorage, migration, proliferation,
3||differentiation, and survival. Collagen is defined by high mechanical strength, good
3||biocompatibility, low antigenicity and ability of being cross-linked, and tailored for its
3||mechanical degradation and water uptake properties; Twenty-seven types of collagens have
3||been identified so far, but collagen type I is the most abundant and the most investigated for
3||biomedical applications (Chunlin et al., 2004).
3||Collagen may also be processed into a variety of formats including porous sponges, gels,
3||and sheets. It can be cross-linked with chemicals to make it stronger or to alter its
3||degradation rate (Cuy, 2004). However, for medical applications, the implantation of foreign
3||cells causes immunological problems. Collagen has potential uses as follows (Matin, 2004):
3||- Collagen gel matrix maintains its shape following cell seeding and culture,
3||- Highly permeable bio-scaffold design,
3||- Production of tissue implants for reconstructive/cosmetic surgery applications, and
3||- Generation of spinal cord repair implants.
3||- Chitosan
3||Chitosan is a cationic polymer obtained from chitin comprising copolymers of β (1→4)-
3||glucosamine and N-acetyl- D-glucosamine. Chitin is a natural polysaccharide found
3||particularly in the shell of crustacean, cuticles of insects and cell walls of fungi and is the
3||second most abundant polymerized carbon found in nature (Khor & Lim, 2003).
3||This polymer has many suitable properties. It can be used for wound dressing, drug
3||delivery, and tissue engineering (cartilage, nerve and liver tissue) applications. These
3||properties include: (Willerth et al., 2007):
3||- Minimal foreign body reaction,
3||- Mild processing conditions (synthetic polymers often need to be dissolved in harsh
3||chemicals; chitosan will dissolve in water based on pH),
3||- Controllable mechanical/biodegradation properties (such as scaffold porosity or
3||polymer length), and
3||- Availability of chemical side groups for attachment to other molecules.
3||Chitosan has already been investigated for adoption in the engineering of cartilage, nerve,
3||and liver tissue. Current difficulties applying chitosan as a polymer scaffold in tissue
3||engineering include low strength and inconsistent behavior with seeded cells (Madihally
3||and Matthew, 1999). Fortunately, chitosan may be easily combined with other materials in
3||order to increase its strength and cell-attachment potential. Mixtures with synthetic
3||polymers such as poly (vinyl alcohol) and poly (ethylene glycol), or natural polymers such
3||as collagen, have already been produced. These combinations promise improving the
3||performance of the combined construct over the behavior of either component alone (Cuy,
3||2004).
3||- Agarose/alginate
3||Agarose and alginate are linear polysaccharides obtained from seaweed and algae,
3||respectively. Both polygosaccharides must undergo extensive purification to prevent
3||immune responses after implantation (Willerth et al., 2007). Moreover, encapsulation of
3||certain cell types into alginate beads may actually enhance cell survival and growth. In
4||156 Biomaterials Science and Engineering
4||addition, alginate has been explored to function in liver, nerve, heart, and cartilage tissue
4||engineering.
4||Unfortunately some drawbacks to alginate include mechanical weakness and poor cell
4||adhesion. In order to overcome these limitations, the strength and cell behavior of alginate
4||have been enhanced by mixtures with other materials, including the natural polymers
4||agarose and Chitosan (Cuy, 2004). Mohan et al. described the preparation and
4||characterization of alginate sponges to be used as scaffolds in tissue engineering. They
4||fabricated highly porous 3D scaffolds from cheaply available sodium alginate, which
4||exhibits good biocompatibility. The scaffold fabricated by a combination of freeze drying
4||and particulate leaching, showed increased porosity and pore size. Better pore
4||characteristics and swelling properties may permit more cell invasion and nutrient supply.
4||Moreover alginate is thermally stable, non-cytotoxic and biodegradable (Mohan and Nair,
4||2005).
4||- Fibronectin
4||Fibronectin (FN) is a glycoprotein which exists outside cells and on the cell surface. It also
4||exists in blood, other body fluids and on the cell surfaces of connective tissue. This protein
4||associates with the other proteins of the extra cellular matrix (ECM) like fibrinogen,
4||collagen, glycosaminoglycans and with suitable receptors which are in the cell membrane
4||(Ebner et al., 2006). Fibronectin is composed of tandem repeats of three distinct types (I, II
4||and III) of individually folded modules.
4||2.2.2 Synthetic materials
4||Synthetic polymers have been widely used for over 20 years as surgical sutures, with long
4||established clinical success and many are approved for human use by the Food and Drug
4||Administration (FDA). The polymers which approved by FDA are as follows: PCL, PLLA,
4||PLGA, PEG and PGA.
4||However current synthetic polymers do not possess a surface chemistry which is familiar to
4||cells, that in vivo thrive on an extracellular matrix made mostly of collagen, elastin,
4||glycoproteins, proteoglycans, laminin and fibronectin; these materials have many
4||advantages to be used as scaffolds (Sachlos & Czernuszka, 2003, as cited Alberts et al., 1994).
4||These polymers can be tailored to produce a wide range of mechanical properties and
4||degradation rates. Synthetic polymers also represent a more reliable source of raw materials
4||with the ability to provoke an immune response in body. Finally synthetic polymers can be
4||react together to combine their unique properties (Willerth et al., 2007; Manzanedo, 2005).
4||Here some of these synthetic polymers used in tissue engineering are described briefly.
4||- Poly (D, L- lactic acid)
4||Poly lactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable polyester attainable by poly-condensation of lactic
4||acid, and amonomeric precursor that can be obtained from renewable resources. Lactic acid
4||is a chiral molecule available in the L and D stereoisomer forms. L-lactic acid occurs in the
4||metabolism of all animals and microorganism, and thus is an absolutely non-toxic
4||degradation product of polylactides. This is proved by the successful application of
4||polylactides as a resorbable medical structure over a period of three decades (kricheldorf,
4||2001; Onose, 2008).
4||Since this polymer has biodegradability, biocompatibility, good mechanical properties, and
4||ability to be dissolved in common solvents for processing, it has been successfully employed
4||as matrixes for cell transplantation and tissue regenerations (Kim et al., 2003).
5||The Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 157
5||- Poly (lactic-co- glycolic acid)
5||Poly (glycolic acid) (PGA) and poly (lactic acid) (PLA) are biodegradable synthetic
5||polymers, which can react to form the copolymer poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). PGA
5||is highly crystalline and has a high melting point and low solubility in organic solvents. An
5||intensive investigation aimed at the improvement of PGA properties was undertaken by
5||many researchers, focusing on the preparation of PGA copolymers with more hydrophilic
5||PLA.
5||After implantation, the ester bonds that make up the backbone of the polymer can be
5||hydrolyzed, causing the scaffold to degrade into metabolite by-products. These by-products
5||can be absorbed by the body and may cause pH changes around the implantation site. The
5||degradation rate of the scaffolds can be altered by varying the ratio of PGA to PLA in the
5||scaffold.
5||The presence of an extra methyl group renders lactic acid more hydrophobic. The
5||hydrophobicity of PLA limits the water uptake of films to 2%, and decreases the backbone
5||hydrolysis rate in respect to the one of the PGA homopolymer. Moreover, PLA is more
5||soluble in organic solvents than in PGA. It is important to note that no linear relationship
5||exists between the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid and the physico-mechanical properties
5||of their regarding copolymers. The high crystallinity of PGA is rapidly lost in PGA/PLA
5||copolymers. These morphological changes lead to an increase in the hydration and
5||hydrolysis rate and copolymers tend to degrade more rapidly than the homopolymers of
5||PGA or PLA do (Reed et al., 1981).
5||- Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate
5||Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a linear head-to-tail homopolymer of (R)-β hydroxybutiric
5||acid, which forms crystalline cytoplasmic granules in the wide variety of bacteria. This
5||material is biodegradable and biocompatible microbially produced polyester, which after
5||implantation degrades slowly at body temperature and forms a non-toxic metabolite that is
5||secreted in urine (Mosahebi et al., 2001). PHB has been previously used as a wound
5||scaffolding device, designed to support and protect a wound against further damage while
5||promoting healing by encouraging cellular growth on and within the device from the
5||wound surface (Ljungberg et al., 1999).
5||- Poly-e-caprolactone
5||Poly-e-caprolactone(PCL), an aliphatic polyester which is bioresorbable and biocompatible,
5||is generally used in pharmaceutical products and wound dressings (Venugopal et al., 2005).
5||This polymer has low melting point of around 60°C and a glass transition temperature of
5||about −60°C. PCL is degraded by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in physiological conditions
5||(e.g. in the human body) and therefore, has received a great deal of attention for use as an
5||implantable biomaterial (Schnell et al., 2007).
5||- Poly (ethylene glycol)
5||Poly ethylene glycol (PEG), also known as poly ethylene oxide (PEO) or polyoxyethylene
5||(POE) is the most commercially important polyethers, which refers to an oligomer or polymer
5||of ethylene oxide resisting protein adsorption and cell adhesion. These characteristics help
5||minimize the immune response after implantation. Additionally, this polymer can also help to
5||seal cell membranes after injury, making it useful for limiting cell death. Hydrophilic PEG
5||hydrogels can be made through a variety of cross- linking schemes to create scaffolds with
5||varying degradation as well as release rates. Further chemistry can be used to modify these
5||gels to add sites for cell adhesion or extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules to allow cells to
5||infiltrate into these scaffolds, extending their potential applications (Willerth et al., 2007).
6||158 Biomaterials Science and Engineering
6||PEG can be photo-polymerized under mild conditions in the presence of cells to create a
6||hydrogel that is biocompatible and non-toxic. Bioactive molecules such as cell adhesion
6||ligands, growth factors and proteolytic degradation sites have been previously incorporated
6||into PEG hydrogels and shown to influence adhesion, proliferation, migration, and
6||extracellular matrix production of vascular smooth muscle cells.
6||- Poly (glycerol sebacic acid)
6||Poly glycerol sebacic acid (PGS), also called bio-rubber, is a tough, biodegradable elastomer
6||made from biocompatible monomers. Its main features are good mechanical properties,
6||rubber like elasticity and surface erosion biodegradation. PGS was proved to have similar in
6||vitro and in vivo biocompatibility to PLGA, a widely used biodegradable polymer.
6||(Manzanedo, 2005; Sundback et al., 2005).
6||- Poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)
6||Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) is a hydro-soluble monomer, which can be
6||polymerized (under various circumstances) at low temperatures (from -20°C to +10°C). It
6||can be used to prepare various hydrogels and to immobilize proteins or cells. It is widely
6||used in medicine as an appropriate biomaterial. Poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)
6||(pHEMA) is particularly attractive for biomedical engineering applications. Because of its
6||physical properties and high biocompatibility, this polymer can be easily manipulated
6||through formulated chemistry has been extensively used in medical applications, e.g.
6||contact lenses, kerato prostheses and orbital implants. Furthermore, a pHEMA scaffold
6||could be easily incorporated into the nerve guidance tubes (Flynn et al., 2003).
6||2.3 Methods used for scaffolds design
6||Several techniques have been developed to process synthetic and natural scaffold materials
6||into porous structures. These conventional scaffold fabrication techniques are considered as
6||processes that create scaffolds having a continuous, uninterrupted pore structure. An
6||overview of such different techniques is as follows: Electrospinning, Solvent-casting,
6||particulate-leaching, Gas foaming, Fiber meshes/fiber bonding, Phase separation, Melt
6||molding, Emulsion freeze drying, Solution casting and Freeze drying (Mikos& Temenoff,
6||2003; Sachlos & Czernuszka, 2003).
6||2.3.1 Electrospinning
6||Electrospinning is a technique for nano-fibrous scaffold fabrication. Various synthetic or
6||natural polymers can be spun to nano fibers with diameters in nano - to micrometer range.
6||They are characterized by a high surface to volume ratio and thus offer sample substrate for
6||cell attachment.
6||In this technique, polymers are dissolved into a proper solvent or melted before being
6||subjected to a very high voltage to overcome the surface tension and viscoelastic forces as
6||well as forming different fibers (50 nm - 30 µm) diameters, which feature a morphologic
6||similarity to the extracellular matrix of natural tissue and effective mechanical properties.
6||These nanofibrous scaffolds can be utilized to provide a better environment for cell
6||attachment, migration, proliferation and differentiation when compared with traditional
6||scaffolds (Martins et al., 2007).
6||In general, the process of electrospinning is mainly affected by (i) system parameters, such as
6||polymer molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and solution properties (e.g.
6||viscosity, surface tension, conductivity); and (ii) process parameters, such as flow rate, electric
6||potential, distance between capillary and collector, motion of collector, etc (Yang et al., 2005).
7||The Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 159
7||A study on the fabrication of a scaffold by electrospinning biomaterials such as poly lactic
7||acid (PLA), poly glycolic acid (PGA), poly (ethylene-co- vinyl acetate) (PEVA), and type-I
7||collagen was reported (Bowlin et al., 2001). Moreover, nanostructured electrospun PLGA
7||membranes for anti-adhesion applications were presented (Fang et al., 2001).
7||Electrospinning can even be used to create biocompatible thin films with useful coating
7||designs and surface structures that can be deposited on implantable devices in order to
7||facilitate the integration of these devices with the body (Buchko et al., 1999).
7||The collagen nanofibers were characterized by a wide range of pore size distribution, high
7||porosity, excellent mechanical strength and high surface area to volume ratios, which are
7||favorable parameters for cell attachment, growth and proliferation. In cell activity
7||assessment, electrospun collagen nanofibers coated with type I collagen or laminin were
7||found to promote cell adhesion and spread of normal human keratinocytes. This may be a
7||consequence of the high surface area available for cell attachment due to their three-
7||dimensional features and restoration of biological and structural properties of natural ECM
7||proteins (Rho et al., 2006).
7||2.3.2 Freeze-drying
7||Many of the fabrication technologies for polymers are based on particulate-leaching
7||techniques, heat compression, and extrusion. However, the harsh operating conditions of
7||these processes may limit the incorporation of bioactive proteins, cells and residual amounts
7||of the chemical solvents required may cause toxicity in vivo. Freeze-drying is an alternative
7||method to produce porous scaffolds, which do not require additional chemicals relying on
7||the water.
7||This method, used in hydrogels, forms ice crystals that can be sublimated from the polymer,
7||creating a particular micro-architecture. Because the direction of growth and size of the ice
7||crystals are a function of the temperature gradient, linear, radial, and/or random pore
7||directions and diverse sizes can be produced with this methodology (Stokols et al., 2004).
7||On the other hand, the pore size can be controlled by the freezing rate and pH; a fast
7||freezing rate produces smaller pores (Sachlos et al., 2003).
7||2.3.3 Molding
7||Graft implants manufacture is an extraordinary example of micro-architecture. One possible
7||way of making the grafts is the particulate leaching technique (i.e. molding). A mold is
7||made of a medium that may not contaminate the graft and that may melt off at a lower
7||temperature melt point than that of the graft. Already widely used, this method limits
7||design intricacy because heat stress during formation compromises the composition of the
7||graft (Friedman et al., 2002). Another problem with this method is that it would be difficult
7||to make a mold small enough for small animal research. As an example, Moore et al. used
7||Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with copolymer ratio 85:15 for their initial experiments.
7||Injection molding with rapid solvent evaporation resulted in scaffolds with a plurality of
7||distinct channels running parallel along the length of the scaffolds (Moore et al., 2006).
7||2.3.4 Solid free form fabrication
7||The most promising production method is called solid free-form fabrication (SFF). This
7||approach uses a machine like an inkjet printer to make the graft one layer at time by
7||“printing” one layer on top of the other (Friedman et al., 2002). However, the main problem
8||160 Biomaterials Science and Engineering
8||with this technology is the extremely high cost. The machines have to be permanently
8||modified from their original function. Through these methods one can manage pore size,
8||porosity and pore distribution to produce structures to increase the mass transport of
8||oxygen and nutrients throughout the scaffold.
8||Although there are several commercial variants of SFF technology, the general process
8||involves producing a computer-generated model using computer-aided design (CAD)
8||software. After expression of cross- sectional layers, data is implemented to the SFF machine
8||to produce the physical model. Through building the layers from bottom to up, each newly
8||formed layer adheres to the previous. Post-processing may be required to remove
8||temporary support structures (Sachlos & Czernuszka, 2003). The methods that use the SSF
8||technologies to fabricate tissue engineering scaffold are: (1) stereolithography (SLA), (2)
8||selective laser sintering (SLS), (3) fused deposition modelling (FDM) and (4) three-
8||dimensional printing (3-DP).
8||3. Challenges in engineering scaffolds
8||The major hindrance through tissue engineering constructs is mass transfer. Since scaffolds
8||provide large surface area to volume ratios, it is proved that mass transfer limitation is
8||reduced. Pore interconnectivity directly influences the mass transfer (e.g. oxygen and
8||nutrient supply and removal of toxic metabolites).
8||During tissue regeneration, permeability of the matrix decreases due to the declined pore
8||size. In addition, the size of most engineered tissues is limited as they do not have their own
8||blood system, and the cells are only supplied by diffusion (Griffith & Naughton, 2002;
8||Kannan et al., 2005). Meanwhile, as only cell layers of 100–200 μm thickness can absorb O
8||2
8||by diffusion, oxygen supply is particularly a critical issue. However, since tissue
8||constructions should have larger dimensions, mass transfer limitation can be considered as
8||one of the greatest engineering challenges (Pörtner et al., 2005).
8||The next challenge is mechanical effect on cells in dynamic systems. Under flow conditions,
8||flow rate needs to be optimized based on (i) nutrient distribution, (ii) effect on assembly of
8||matrix elements and (iii) cellular response to local shear stress (Lawrence et al., 2009). The
8||scaffold architecture affects the local fluid flow velocities of the cell suspension which
8||influences the number of cell-scaffold contacts per time unit and the local cell deposition
8||rates. By changing the scaffolds design, different flow profiles and cell distributions in the
8||scaffolds may be obtained (Melchels et al., 2011).
8||Although flow of growth medium improves nutrient and waste transport, shear stresses
8||induced by fluid flow could affect the scaffold architecture as well as cellular alignment
8||within the structures (Lawrence et al., 2009 as cited Gray et al., 1988; Huang et al., 2005).The
8||wall shear rate determines the hydrodynamic force, that adhering cells are exposed to,
8||which can be expressed per unit of area as the wall shear stress (in Pa), and is the product of
8||the wall shear rate and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid medium. The critical shear stress
8||for cell detachment has been found to range almost between 1 to 3 Pa that depends on the
8||material on which the cells are cultured. Also the highest cell densities in the scaffolds could
8||be observed in the regions with larger pores, higher fluid flow velocities and higher wall
8||shear rates (Melchels et al., 2011 cited as Isenberg et al., 2006; Macario et al., 2008; Smith et
8||al., 1995).
8||It has been seen that the pore size is a variable strongly affecting the predicted shear stress
8||level, whereas the porosity only influence the statistical distribution of the shear stress
9||The Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 161
9||(Sadir, 2011). Furthermore, it has been showed that porosity and pore size affect pressure
9||drop which is important to be determined during tissue regeneration (Lawrence et al., 2009,
9||cited as Sodian et al., 2000). For the same pore size with decreasing porosities, pressure drop
9||increases, and for the constant porosity with reducing pore size, which could limit the fluid
9||flow and nutrient transport, pressure drop is increased (Sadir, 2011). Here these challenges
9||are investigated by the revision of two case studies.
9||3.1 Vascular system
9||The primary functions of blood vessels are the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the
9||tissues and organs of the body and removal of their respective metabolites for clearance or
9||re-oxygenation (Boland et al., 2004). Diseases of the heart and blood vessels are the most life
9||threatening factor in developed countries (Ikada, 2006). Surgical replacement of vessel
9||segments or bypass surgery is the most common intervention for coronary and peripheral
9||atherosclerotic disease with at least 550,000 bypass performed per year (Chung et al., 2010).
9||Autologous vessels harvested from the patient for bypass surgery include the saphenous
9||vein (SV) from the leg and the internal mammary artery (IMA) from the chest wall. The IMA
9||with elasticity maintains the ability to vasoregulate and is less prone to atherosclerosis (Wise
9||et al., 2011). Apart from the fact that implantation of native vessels is limited by the
9||mismatch of dimensional and mechanical properties (Chung et al., 2010), the acceptable vein
9||is not available in 30 %of patients (Boland et al., 2004).
9||An artery is composed of three layers having different matrix-tissue compositions. The
9||innermost lumen layer (intima) is composed of endothelial cells (ECs) on extracellular
9||matrixes such as type IV collagen and elastin, providing the necessary antithrombogenic
9||nature for contact with the bloodstream. The middle layer (media) is usually the thickest of
9||the three layers and is composed of multiple layers of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within a
9||surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of collagen types I and III, elastin fibers
9||and various proteoglycans. The outermost layer (adventitia) is made of fibroblastic cells on
9||randomly arranged type I collagen. In short the collagens impart tensile strength to the
9||vessel wall while elastin provides the elasticity (Boland et al., 2004) (Thomas et al., 2007).
9||With respect to this construction, the combined structure is particularly attractive for
9||vascular tissue engineering applications. By designing a multilayered tube, it is now
9||possible to seed or co-culture different cell lines in layers with controlled orientation (Chung
9||et al., 2010).
9||Tissue engineering uses vascular cells and supporting scaffolds to build functional blood
9||vessels (Tillman et al., 2009). In the domain of cells, both the EC and SMC are critical
9||components of a tissue engineered vascular graft. ECs play an integral role in tissue
9||homeostasis, fibrinolysis, and anti-coagulation while SMCs perform many functions,
9||including vasoconstriction and dilatation, synthesis of various types of collagen, elastin and
9||proteoglycans (Ju et al., 2010). Bare scaffolds without ECs showed abundant platelet
9||adherence, while scaffolds lined with ECs resisted adherence of blood elements. While it is
9||evident that cells play a major role in achieving patent vessels, designing a vascular
9||scaffolds that provide structural support, enabling cells to proliferate and growing into a
9||three-dimensional (3-D) tissue is important (Chung et al., 2010; Tillman et al., 2009)
9||Developing scaffolds that can withstand the pulsatile nature, high pressure, and high flow
9||rate of the bloodstream (Boland et al., 2004) is especially necessary in cardiovascular
9||applications. The ideal vascular prostheses must be a presentation of its functional
9||characters such as flexibility with kink resistance and biocompatibility (non-thrombogenic)
10||162 Biomaterials Science and Engineering
10||(Boland et al., 2004). Ability of ECs adherence to form an anti-thrombogenic luminal surface,
10||and SMCs migration, exhibit vasoactive properties, (Williamson et al., 2006 cited as Tiwari
10||et al., 2001; Seifalian et al., 2002), capability of withstanding physiological hemodynamic
10||forces while maintaining structural integrity until mature tissue forms in vivo (Ju et al.,
10||2010), and also the compliance is matched with that of the native artery (Boland et al., 2004).
10||Additionally, providing interconnected pores, generating high porosity so as to promote
10||cell–cell and cell–matrix communication and having sufficient mechanical stability are key
10||factors (Chung et al., 2010) for the engineering of blood vessels. Small pore size does not
10||bring about a problem for ECs but would limit the ability of SMCs to colonize the outer
10||portion of neo- vessel. Several approaches have been proposed to generate large sized pores
10||which include the use of the salt leaching technique (Ju et al., 2010, cited as Nam et al., 2007)
10||and coelectrospinning with water-soluble polymers which serve as sacrificial fibers.
10||Researchers indicated that a larger pore size can be achieved by increasing the fiber
10||diameter and that this would facilitate cell infiltration. They showed that the mechanical
10||strength of the scaffolds decreases as fiber diameter increases (Ju et al., 2010).
10||Of the countless synthetic materials evaluated over the years, expanded poly tetrafluoro
10||ethylene (e-PTFE) and woven or knitted polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers have
10||proven to be satisfactory in terms of medium (6-10 mm internal diameter (ID)) and large
10||(>10 mm ID) vascular prosthetics, respectively (Boland et al., 2004). However, clinical
10||success for small diameter (<6 mm) vessels has yet to be demonstrated due to complications
10||such as occlusion, thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia (Chung, 2010).
10||In addition, biodegradable synthetic polymer scaffolds from polyglycolic acid (PGA), poly-
10||L-lactic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates such as poly-4-hydroxybutyrate, polycaprolactone -
10||copolylactic acid and polyethylene glycol have been explored. On the other hand, natural
10||polymers such as collagen and fibrin have also been utilized to construct biological vascular
10||grafts, populated and compacted by smooth muscle cells, and exhibiting high tensile
10||strength and flexibility (Zhang et al., 2008).
10||However, future attempts are addressed as: (i) maufacture of scaffolds with ECM-like nano -
10||fibrous structure; (ii) development of the electrospun structures to manage pore size which
10||improves the ingrowth of large sized cells; (iii) test the structural integrity of these scaffolds
10||during degradation and under dynamic culture conditions (Vaz et al, 2005).
10||In some cases these materials have been coated with cell-adhesive proteins such as
10||fibronectin, vitronectin and laminin to facilitate EC attachment, which effectively renders
10||the surface to become antithrombogenic However, such modifications can also provide
10||good substrates for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. EC must be able to resist
10||detachment by the high shear forces exerted by blood flow and turbulence, thereby
10||providing an anti-thrombotic surface. They should also retain vasoactive function but not
10||induce immune reactions to the implant (Williamson et al., 2006, cited as Tiwari et al., 2001).
10||Based on these results, Ku and Park. suggested that Poly dopamine (PDA) coating generally
10||facilitates the cell adhesion process of culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells
10||(HUVECs) on electrospun PCL nanofibers. The increase of cell adhesion on this coated
10||nanofibers are attributed to the adsorption/immobilization of serum proteins on PDA ad-
10||layer (Ku & Park, 2010).
10||As it was mentioned about vascular tissue construction, designing a multilayered tube is
10||attractive to seed or co- culture different cell lines in layers with controlled orientation. Vaz
10||et al. fabricated a bi- layered tubular scaffold of PLA (outer layer) and PCL (inner layer) by
10||multi-layering electrospinning (ME) using a rotating mandrel-type collector. The tensile
11||The Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 163
11||measurements showed that PLA/PCL scaffolds presented a much lower elongation and a
11||four-fold increase of maximum stress compared to electrospun PCL ones. The PLA/PCL bi-
11||layered scaffold supported the attachment, spread and growth of mouse fibroblasts (Vaz et
11||al, 2005).
11||Morever, Venugopal et al. proved that PCL nanofibrous matrixes coated with collagen
11||support cell growth or make the three-dimensional structured multilayer of PCL nanofibers
11||and collagen nanofibers suitable for blood vessel engineering. Their report defines the initial
11||adhesion mechanism of SMCs to the sebiocompatible poly (caprolactone) nanofibrous
11||matrixes coated with collagen. These results may be relevant to other cell types (Venugopal
11||et al., 2005c).
11||Wise et al. reported the production of synthetic human elastin and poly caprolactone
11||multilayered vascular graft which mimics the mechanical properties of the human IMA.
11||They showed that conduits constructed from synthetic elastin (SE) alone had insufficient
11||strength for vascular applications. This graft was systematically modified by addition of
11||PCL, which was selected on the basis of its appropriate mechanical properties and a slow
11||degradation time. On the other hand, they found that PCL interacts with platelets, which
11||can contribute to thrombogenicity. For this reason, the graft lumen was made of pure SE i.e.
11||devoid of PCL to significantly reduce platelet adhesion, in contrast to PCL/collagen hybrids
11||which showed abundant platelet adherence. It should also be mentioned that the outer layer
11||of the graft, a hybrid of SE/PCL modulated the graft mechanic (Wise et al., 2011).
11||On the other hand, the nanolayer can mimic the ECM, whereas the micro layer provides
11||larger pores which facilitate superior cell infiltration; a micro - and nano-combined
11||structures can be advantageous.
11||Chung et al. combined electrospinning and melt spinning of poly (L-lactide-co-e-
11||caprolactone) (50:50 PLCL) to fabricate a multilayered tubular construct using a rotating
11||mandrel for both techniques, which makes the nano layer able to adhere completely to the
11||micro layer. They showed that copolymers of PLCL exhibit a range of mechanical properties
11||from rigid solids to elastomers, depending on their composition. Furthermore, it has a slow
11||rate of degradation compared to other bioresorbable polymers such as PGA and PLA
11||(Chung et al., 2010).
11||Additionally, Surface patterns such as microgrooves have been successfully used to induce
11||both alignment of cell shape and directional cell migration. Uttayarat et al, incorporated
11||both electrospun microfibers and surface microgrooves in the fabrication of 3D synthetic
11||polyurethane (PU) grafts. They found that grooved patterns induced the uniform alignment
11||of endothelial cell monolayers with morphology similar to naturally aligned endothelium
11||under hemodynamic flow. They also extended these findings by demonstrating that a
11||groove depth or a fiber diameter of about 1 µm can guide the alignment of endothelial cells
11||inside tubular PU grafts (Uttayarat et al., 2010).
11||3.2 Nerve and spinal cord system
11||The nervous system is classified into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral
11||nervous system (PNS). The CNS comprises the brain, spinal cord, optic, olfactory and
11||auditory systems. Considering these organs, the CNS comprises of a vast number of
11||neurons, astroglia, microglia, and oligodendrocytes.
11||The spinal cord which is approximately 1 cm thick and 42 cm long has four anatomical
11||divisions; the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions. About 27 %of human spinal cord
11||injuries are lacerations caused by penetrating objects that tear the spinal tissue (Open
12||164 Biomaterials Science and Engineering
12||injuries) resulting in a discontinuity of the cord. The majority of the clinical cases are the
12||result of a temporary compression of the cord that leaves the cord surface intact (closed
12||injuries 73%). Three types of compression injuries are described: massive compression,
12||contusion, and solid cord injury (E.Schmidt et al., 2003; Erschbamer, 2007).
12||CNS axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment. Several glycoproteins
12||in the native extracellular environment (myelin) of the CNS are inhibitory for regeneration.
12||Regeneration in the adult CNS requires a multi-step process. First, the injured neuron must
12||survive, and then the damaged axon must extend its cut processes to its original neuronal
12||targets. According to Horner and Gage investigation, once contact is made, the axon needs
12||to be re-myelinated and functional synapses need to form on the surface of the targeted
12||neurons (Horner and Gage., 2000).
12||In addition to the nerve graft and other natural tissues, such as autologous muscle and vein
12||grafts, biopolymers can be a practical tool to provide neurotrophic and/or cellular support
12||while simultaneously guiding axonal regeneration (Stokols et al., 2004; Rodriguez et al.,
12||2000). Indeed, numerous natural and synthetic polymers have been used as scaffolds or
12||within scaffolds for peripheral and central nerve regeneration.
12||Filling of the interior channels with appropriate cell facilitates axon regeneration. The Schwann
12||cell (SC) and its basal lamina are crucial components in the environment through which
12||regenerating axons grow to reach their peripheral targets. They produce myelin, which has
12||important effects on the speed of transmission of electrical signals and are shown to enhance
12||the regeneration of axons in both the peripheral and central nervous systems (Erschbamer,
12||2007; Alovskaya et al., 2007). Therefore, it seems that application of a nerve grafts (scaffolds)
12||coated with SCs can be an appropriate method for spinal cord regeneration.
12||Considering the requirements of scaffolds in general and in particular, i.e. in neural tissue
12||engineering, materials appropriate for SC seeding should posse some additional features. In
12||order to successfully design a scaffold that can be used as treatment for SCI, many
12||considerations must be taken into account. The scaffold should lessen glial scar formation,
12||while containing sites for cell adhesion to allow regenerating neurons to extend axons into
12||the injury site (Willerth et al., 2007; Radulescu et al., 2007).
12||Among natural materials, Matin in 2004 found that implants coated with collagen are more
12||successful than the bare ones. Stokolos et al. chose to fabricate scaffolds with agarose for
12||several reasons. First, when implanted into lesion cavities in the spinal cord as an
12||unstructured solid agarose hydrogel, it did not evoke an immune or inflammatory response
12||and was stable for at least 1 month. Second, it was observed that neither axons nor cells
12||penetrated solid agarose hydrogels, which suggested that walls composed of agarose could
12||effectively delineate pathways for regenerating axons. Third, freeze-drying could be used to
12||fabricate agarose into soft and flexible scaffold. Finally, neurotrophic factors, proven to elicit
12||robust axonal growth could be easily incorporated into these scaffolds.
12||In other researches, Alvskaya et al. described that by using fibronectin as a substrate in an in
12||vivo model of spinal cord repair, the growth of neuritis within the material is accompanied
12||by migration of SCs into the graft and the presence of reactive astrocytes at its surface
12||continued. Within the first 2 weeks of implantation, a number of cells and cellular elements
12||replaced the FN mat as it dissolved. The first cells to infiltrate FN mats were macrophages.
12||The presence of integrin receptors on Schwann cells may be responsible for the extensive
12||infiltration of Schwann cells. The close spatial correspondence between laminin tubules and
12||Schwann cells suggests that they were deposited by the Schwann cells (Alovskaya et al.,
12||2007; King et al., 2006).
13||The Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 165
13||Along with natural materials, synthetic polymers have been widely used for tissue
13||engineering. Recently, Patist et al. demonstrated that the implantation of a macro porous
13||PLA tubular scaffold in the transected rat spinal cord elicited a modest axonal regeneration
13||response. These particular scaffolds were prepared by a thermally induced polymer-solvent
13||phase separation process and contained longitudinally oriented macropores connected to
13||each other by a network of micropores (Patist et al., 2004).
13||Moore et al. described multiple-channel, biodegradable scaffolds that serve as the basis for a
13||model to investigate simultaneously the effects of scaffold architecture, transplanted cells,
13||and locally delivered molecular agents on axon regeneration. PLGA with copolymer ratio
13||85:15 was used for their experiments. Primary neonatal Schwann cells were distributed in
13||the channels of the scaffold and remained viable in tissue culture for at least 48 h. Scaffolds
13||containing SCs implanted into transected adult rat spinal cords contained regenerating
13||axons at 1 month post-operation. Axon regeneration was demonstrated by three-
13||dimensional reconstruction of serial histological sections (Moore et al., 2006).
13||Also it is showed that PGS which have similar in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility to PLGA,
13||had no harmful effect on Schwann cell metabolic activity, attachment, or proliferation, and
13||did not induce apoptosis (Manzanedo, 2005; Sundback et al., 2005).
13||PHB has been previously used as a wrap-around implant to guide axonal growth after
13||peripheral nerve injury ( Ljungberg et al., 1999). Novikova et al. prepared a biodegradable
13||conduit made of PHB fibers which compressed together and running in parallel directions
13||in two perpendicular layers to form a sheet. Implantation of these PHB conduits coated with
13||alginate hydrogel and fibronectin and seeded with SCs has been found to reduce spinal cord
13||cavitation as well as retrograde degeneration of injured spinal tract neurons (Novikov et al.,
13||2002).
13||PCL is interesting for the preparation of long term implantable devices, owing to its
13||degradation, which is even slower than that of polylactide. Schnell et al. designed
13||biodegradable, aligned poly-e-capro- lactone (PCL) and collagen/PCL (C/PCL) nanofibers
13||as guidance structures were produced by electrospinning and tested in cell culture assays.
13||They compared fibers of 100% PCL with fibers consisting of a 25:75% C/PCL blend. Both
13||types of electrospun fibers supported oriented neurite outgrowth and glial migration from
13||dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants. SC migration, neurite orientation, and process
13||formation of SCs, fibroblasts and olfactory ensheathing cells were improved on C/PCL
13||fibers, when compared to pure PCL fibers ( Schnell et al., 2007 ).
13||About PEG, it was showed that focal continuous application of this polymer has minimal
13||toxicity (Cole and Shi, 2005). Duerstock et al. used three- dimensional computer reconstructions
13||of PEG treated and spinal cords to determine whether the pathological character of a 1- month-
13||old injury is ameliorated by application of PEG. In PEG- treated animals, the lesion was more
13||focal and less diffuse throughout the damaged segment of the spinal cord, so that control
13||cords showed a significantly extended lesion surface area (Duerstock and Borgens, 2002).
13||Furthermore, a pHEMA scaffold could be easily incorporated into the nerve guidance tubes.
13||Flynn et al. developed a method to create longitude in ally oriented channels within
13||(pHEMA) hydrogels for neural tissue engineering applications. They found that these
13||scaffolds have the potential to enhance nerve regeneration after section injuries of the spinal
13||cord by increasing the available surface area and providing guidance to extending axons
13||and invading cells (Flynn et al., 2003).
13||Several techniques have been developed to process synthetic and natural scaffold materials
13||into porous structures as H. Tabesh et al. reviewed. Among these techniques, creating tissue
14||166 Biomaterials Science and Engineering
14||engineering scaffolds in nano-scale may bring unpredictable new properties to the material-
14||such as mechanical (stronger), physical (lighter), more porous (tunable),optical (color
14||emission), chemical reactivity (more active and less corrosive), electronic properties (more
14||electrically conductive),and magnetic properties (super paramagnetic which are very
14||important in nerve regeneration). Such scaffolds may come up with new functionalities as
14||well-which are unavailable at micro or macro scales (Tabesh et al., 2009).
14||The process of electrospinning is used for nano-fibrous scaffold fabrication. Electrospinning
14||can even be used to create biocompatible thin films with useful coating designs and surface
14||structures that can be deposited on implantable devices inorder to facilitate the integration
14||of these devices with the body. Silk-like polymers with fibronectin have been electrospun to
14||make biocompatible films used on prosthetic devices aimed to be implanted in the central
14||nervous system (Buchko et al., 1999).
14||Moreover, an elegant way to produce nanofibrous scaffold using PLLA by a liquid–liquid
14||phase separation method quite similar to natural extracellular matrix (ECM) was developed
14||by a group of scientists. They showed its efficacy in supporting the neural stem cell (NSC)
14||differentiation and neurite outgrowth (Yang et al., 2004).
14||In addition, a new and facile method for the creation of longitudinally oriented channels in
14||pHEMA gels using a fiber templating technique was described. Biodegradable
14||polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were extruded and embedded in transparent pHEMA gels,
14||leading to the creation of a pHEMA–PCL composite.
14||4. Conclusion
14||In this chapter, efficacious biomaterials (natural and synthetic) for scaffolds in tissue
14||engineering and cell seeding were discussed and also techniques to their fabrication were
14||reviewed. Considering results using such materials and the mentioned criteria for an
14||appropriate scaffold, it is proved that the selection of materials and method of fabrication
14||depend on the cells and their characteristics. The reasons are: scaffold candidates should
14||mimic the structure and biological activity of the native ECM proteins which provide
14||adequate mechanical support and regulate cellular activates. In addition, scaffolds must
14||support and define the three-dimensional structure of the tissue engineered space and
14||maintain the normal state of differentiation within the cellular compartment.
14||Furthermore the structure of scaffold, pore size and porosity, may affect the mass transfer,
14||shear rate and pressure drop. Mass transfer is the major hindrance in tissue engineering.
14||Although surface area to volume ratios of a scaffold can decrease mass transfer limitations,
14||it is still one of the greatest challenge in tissue engineering. It has been observed that the
14||pore size and shape influence the shear stress level and distribution, while the porosity
14||affects only the distribution. Therefore the wall shear stress is an important parameter in cell
14||adhesion processes.
14||Two case studies, blood and nerve systems, with regard to their challenges have been
14||investigated. First, for blood system, a scaffold must have the function of native blood and
14||must provide appropriate mechanical, endothelialization and antithrombogenic properties.
14||Therefore choosing a proper biomaterial which provides these characters is prominent. With
14||respect to multilayered construction of blood vessels, the combined structure is particularly
14||attractive for vascular tissue engineering applications. For a better simulation, various types
14||of materials and cells have been used to form different layers of this tissue.
15||The Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 167
15||Secondly, for nerve regeneration, it is suggested that blending a synthetic and natural
15||polymer (e.g. poly-e-caprolactone and collagen) is the best choice for Schwann cell seeding
15||to regenerate the spinal cord injuries, considering all results using different materials and
15||the mentioned criteria for an appropriate scaffold. The two suggested polymers have the
15||potential to play role of a scaffold in SCs seeding.
15||Collagen is a protein of ECM and exists in the basal membrane of the cell. It is easily
15||purified, which can be proposed as a proper substance; however, collagen has less strength
15||to withstand long time, support force adhesion, and degrades enzymatically within short
15||periods. Therefore, using another polymer such as PCL to enhance the stability and
15||mechanical strength of collagen would be crucial. In this sence, an excellent scaffold for
15||Schwann cell adhesion, migration, orientation, and proliferation can be provided.
15||Also electrospinning is considered as the excellent method for the fabrication of such
15||scaffolds. Additionally, electrospun nanofibers exhibit excellent supports for nerve growth
15||because they can provide large surface area to volume ratios, pore sizes tailored to Schwann
15||cells dimensions, functionalized surfaces, and multiple sites for interaction and attachment,
15||and low mass transfer limitation.
