Overall, three-dimensional (3D) printing is a technology booming
for processing and development of unique polymeric materials.
In this context, the manufacture of parts layer-by-layer with specific
requirements such as biomedical devices and tissue engineering
may represent an economical option, off ering the flexibility
of starting materials. However, there are many outstanding
challenges to meet. This chapter provides an overview of the field
of 3D-printed biopolymers for medical applications, and future
trends and opportunities in this field.

46 3D Printing of Biopolymers
3.1 Introduction
Since the past decade, tissue engineering has shown a sensational
promise in providing more viable alternatives to surgical procedures
for harvested tissues, implants, and prostheses. Due to the fast
development on biomaterial technologies, it is now possible for
doctors to use patients’ cells to repair orthopedic defects such
as focal articular cartilage lesions. In order to support the three-
dimensional tissue formation, scaff olds made by biocompatible
and bioresorbable polymers and composite materials, produced
by three-dimensional (3D) printing, for providing temporary
support to the damaged body and cell structures have been
developed recently. Although ceramic and metallic materials have
been widely accepted for the development of implants, their non-
resorbability and necessity of second surgical operation result in
extra discomfort for the patients and limit their wide applications
[1].
3D printing is also known as additive manufacturing (AM),
layered manufacturing, rapid prototyping (RP), or solid freeform
fabrication. This technique represents the direct fabrication of
parts layer-by-layer, based on data obtained by computerized
medical imaging equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, using a computer-
aided design (CAD) file [2]. In 3D printing, CAD models of the
parts to be manufactured are first sliced in a virtual environment
to create a stack of two-dimensional (2D) slices. A 3D printing
machine then builds the parts one layer at a time based on the 2D
slice information, stacking and joining successive layers to make
the final 3D object. Just as the Internet has given us the ability
to access information and connect with people from diff erent
parts of the world, CAD has provided us the ability to create,
modify, and, if needed, critique designs in a virtual world. With
the advent of 3D printing, such virtual designs can now be
rendered into physical 3D objects that can serve as prototypes
or be directly used as functional parts for a variety of
applications. In this context, polymers in various forms, reactive,
liquid solutions or as thermoplastic melts play a key role in many
Introduction 47
applications and the further expansion toward manufacturing
robust, real end use products [3].
The origins of contemporary 3D printing can be traced back
to the 1980s when Hull invented stereolithography (SLA), the
first 3D printing technology [4]. SLA is a process in which an
ultraviolet (UV) laser light source is focused onto the surface of a
UV-curable liquid monomer bath and scanned in patterns
representing slice cross sections. The scanned monomers undergo
photo-induced cross-linking and harden to form the desired
2D cross sections, while the uncured monomers remain in the
bath. Hull was also the first to find a way to allow a CAD file to
communicate with the RP system in order to build computer-
modeled parts. Hull’s patent was approved in 1986, making it
the first patent for a 3D printer. The company 3D Systems,
founded by Hull, focused on commercializing SLA systems, which
were the first commercial 3D printers [5].
Fast forward to 2014, when the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) launched the first 3D printing
machine to the International Space Station to directly build
parts in space under zero gravity [6]. This is also the year
when researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory built a
complete car body using a 3D printing technique known as big
area additive manufacturing and partnered with Local Motors
to commission and drive a functional car at the International
Manufacturing Technology Show [7]. 3D printing-based
agile manufacturing technologies are promoting on-demand
production with traditional as well as innovative designs that
are difficult, if not impossible, to make through conventional
manufacturing (CM) approaches. 3D printing technologies
are also making a significant impact in biomedical research—
from device designs to tissue engineering (TE) to bioprinting and
drug delivery.
After following the technology, markets, and publications
over several years, it appears that now we are in a period where
many decisive actors in industry, media, and research and even
finance advisors realize that the traditional area of prototyping
is expanding more and more into manufacturing, and this will
have a significant impact on many areas of our lives, and probably
a spectacular growth of the 3D printing industry [3].

3.2 Brief History of 3D Printing
Several 3D printing technologies were conceived and developed
around the time of the emergence of SLA. Deckard invented
selective laser sintering (SLS) as a graduate student in Beaman’s
group at the University of Texas at Austin [8]. SLS uses powder
materials spread on a build plate where a laser selectively
sinters the powder in certain areas based on the CAD file [6]. A
similar powder bed-based concept formed the basis of another
technology, 3D printing, at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology by Sachs’ group. Inkjet printing was combined with
a powder bed, where a binder was printed onto each successive
layer of swept powder based on the CAD slice information.
Using this approach, complex shaped metal, polymer, and ceramic
parts could be printed. However, post-processing or sintering
steps were often required to enhance the final strength of the
parts [9]. Scott and Lisa Crump developed another 3D printing
technology called fused deposition modeling (FDM). FDM
involves heating a thermoplastic filament to a semi-liquid state,
which is then extruded and deposited through a nozzle onto
a substrate to build parts layer-by-layer based on the CAD file
information [10, 11]. Additionally, Sanders released the first
3D printer based on inkjet printing of thermoplastic polymers
[12]. Parts with fine features could be made easily using this
approach. These are some of the notable early-stage 3D
printing technologies that were primarily focused on RP for design
verification and visualization.
Over the past 15 years, a variety of new technologies have
evolved that have transformed the idea of RP to AM, where parts
produced by a 3D printer can be directly used for a variety of
applications. In the case of metallic materials, laser-based or
electron beam-based technologies with or without a powder
bed have truly revolutionized industrial applications of these
printers. For biomedical applications, novel fabrication
approaches based on the 3D-Bioplotter or direct ink writing,
laser-assisted bioprinting, and robotic-assisted printing are all
in use for diff erent applications. Table 3.1 off ers a brief summary
of some of these technologies that are relevant for biomaterials
and their applications toward TE [13–26]. Other technologies
related to metallic printing are covered throughout this chapter.

Brief History of 3D Printing
52 3D Printing of Biopolymers
An American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
International committee dedicated to the specification of standards
for AM was formed in 2009 [27]. This committee, known as ASTM
F42, created a categorization of all 3D printing technologies into
seven major groups. Table 3.2 shows the major categories along
with the well-known 3D printing technologies that fit within
each category.

3.3 3D Materials Processing Techniques
In general, there are two modes of processing 3D materials: the
extrusion mode and the droplet mode. In the extrusion mode,
3D Materials Processing Techniques 53
the material is extruded out of the nozzle tip under an applied
pressure. This mode can basically lay down the material in the
form of line structures to create the desired model by moving the
nozzle tip over a substrate in the designed path. This process can
be repeated layer by layer to develop a freeform fabricated part.
In the droplet mode, the material is deposited in the form of
droplets that is controlled by using a frequency function and key
parameters in the nozzle system settings. The droplet mode can
form a structured layer by depositing multiple droplets at desired
locations on a substrate. Similarly, this process can be repeated
to fabricate a 3D structure. Figure 3.1 shows a schematic diagram
of the extrusion and droplet mode for the deposition.

Each nozzle system is unique in its method of operation,
which makes each system have its advantages and limitations over
the others. All nozzle systems have a material delivery system.
However, the detailed setup for each system is diff erent and the
material delivery system parameters such as air pressure are not
controlled by in-house software. Characteristics and comparison
of the four nozzle systems with their advantages and limitations
is shown in Table 3.3.

3D Materials Processing Techniques 55
More specifically, these methods of processing 3D materials
can be divided into two distinct groups based on the step, which
defines the shape of each cross section.
As a summary, the first group can be described as a repetitive
process of the following:
(i) Apply a “fluid” material as a thin layer on a workpiece (or
fluid bed) under construction.
(ii) Induce a selective phase change (solidification) on the
current cross section of the work piece.
(iii) Lower the work piece (on a platform) into the fluid bed by
one layer thickness; then repeat.
The second group combines the “imaging” step with the
addition of the material of a full cross section:
(i) Dispense a liquid or liquefied material as small droplets or
filament onto the preceding cross section of the work piece.
(ii) Solidify the new cross section.
(iii) Optionally equalize the new layer to a defined thickness;
then repeat.
A third group is the group of “imaging” on a bulk material
that uses a (ink) jet technology on a powder bed (ASTM: Binder
Jetting) to solidify the loose powder with a liquid solution,
which dries or reacts to agglomerate the powder particles at the
specified locations of each layer. This method was originally
coined with the name “3D printing” by the MIT, but is now used
alongside the other techniques with the same designation.
If we look at the second group of technologies where we
use addition of the material for each full cross section, without
a separate imaging step, we have two major processes, which
dominate the market by machine numbers: (Multi)jet printing
of reactive resins or molten wax (ASTM: Material Jetting) and
extrusion of molten thermoplastics (ASTM: Material Extrusion).
The processes coined as Multijet Modelling or Polyjet use a
print head similar to inkjet printers to deposit exactly shaped
layers of a photopolymer resin, and normally a support material
to partially surround it, which is then immediately cured with a UV
lamp. In order to maintain exact layer thickness and compensate
for small variations of droplet size, current machines use a
56 3D Printing of Biopolymers
mechanical planarizer, which removes excess material on each
pass of the print head.
These machines can process robust resin objects—generally
complex acrylate formulations—with high accuracy and
resolution, and do not require complex lasers and beam scanners.
Some limitations related to materials relate to the viscosity
requirements of the jetting process; often the viscosity is reduced
by heating the print head and nozzle plate. This heating is also
required in machines, which are processing wax materials to
produce patterns for investment casting, in jewelry and dental
restorations applications notably.
A recent development adds machines with multiple print
heads or channels, again similar to color inkjet printers, which
can deposit selected mixtures of diff erent materials. Besides
a palette of colors, this also allows to assign diff erent material
properties, essentially modulus of elasticity, to diff erent regions
of a part. It is another step to replace assemblies of several
components and fasteners with a single part, which is generally
an advantage of additive technologies.
The last technique we look at is based on the original
process of FDM and also relies on a rather simple buildup of an
essentially standard thermoplastic material (ASTM: Material
Extrusion). The concept of melting a “standard” plastic material
and extruding it through a thin, heated nozzle seems quite
straightforward; the extruded melt can then be spread in a
controlled X-Y-movement onto the previous layer of part being
built. Obviously, the processing temperature has to be adapted to
the specific material and well controlled, and thermal shrinkage
after deposition can be reduced by heating the build platform
or even the complete build chamber.
Originally developed and implemented as an industrial quality
process with larger size machines and a selection of thermoplastic
polymers, the scope has now grown into the widest palette of
smaller and low-cost machines. Some of these machines are even
off ered as kits to be built or assembled by the user. Recently,
this type of machines have become very popular and also have
the largest number manufacturers of quite similar devices, mostly
with rather small build volumes of roughly 100 to 200 mm on
each side. While the simple machines just have one extrusion
head and filament spool, many of the newer developments have
3D Materials Processing Techniques 57
multiple heads and can extrude support and part material for
good accuracy and complex shapes, or to combine diff erent
colors in a single part.
The most popular polymers in this process are ABS and
poly lactide, which is also off ered on almost every entry-level
printer, but higher-grade machines can also process engineering
materials such as polycarbonate, polyamide, or even polyphenyl
sulfone. As the starting material in this process already is a
thermoplastic polymer, the mechanical properties of parts
approach those of traditionally molded or machined products,
similar to SLS, but using a significantly simpler machine.
The extrusion-type machines are a specific example that
demonstrate the accelerated progress in the development toward
the wide availability of 3D printers at aff ordable cost, relying
on the assembly of readily available core components such as
precision rails, servo drives, control electronics modules, including
computers and software that can handle the complex geometry
data. The latter is also essential for the design of the 3D model
data based on CAD programs or object scanners; not the least is
the declining cost of computers to handle all these data and
control the machine components.
Another early method that uses paper or other thin films
of material, which are stacked up, bonded together, and cut to
shape was called layered object manufacturing (LOM) and has
now been revived (ASTM: Sheet Lamination) with the possibility
to use standard office paper sheets. Whereas the original
version used an IR laser to cut the individual layers, the more
recent devices cut the paper with a stencil, and a special option
allows printing onto the sheets with an office printer, which
then creates fully colored parts. Whereas paper is a well-known
standard build material, the pressure- or heat-sensitive adhesives
which hold the sheets together are specially developed to fit the
process.
It has been observed that a vast choice of 3D printing
methods is available, many with a variety of materials to choose
from, and generally a large range of possible or preferred
applications. Technically the possibilities are almost without
limits, and on top of the thousands of applications that are
being realized today, there is also a lot of speculation about the
imminent replacement of current production technologies with
58 3D Printing of Biopolymers
these new 3D printers. In reality, the majority of users still apply
these methods to produce prototypes of all kinds, unique parts
and new designs, including architectural models and display
objects. There are quite some areas where 3D printing is
competitive with the cost and speed required for a specific set
of products, and the available materials meet specifications.
Today these applications are mostly in the medical field for
personalized prostheses, in the aeronautical business for low-
volume production of special parts, or complex-shaped tools
and fixtures for traditional manufacturing. The benefits are
particularly high for complex parts, which can often replace an
assembled device with a single print. The user community is
constantly expanding the limits toward manufacturing by 3D
printing, and with progress on the machine side, improved
reliability, build speed, and intuitive user interfaces, the range
of these applications keeps growing steadily. Besides that eff ort,
there is a lot of development in materials to expand the scope of
manufacturing, notably by the machine manufacturers, independent
materials supply companies and at research institutions.
This quest for better materials is also true in the realm of
low-cost printers, which are aff ordable for individuals and schools
at higher levels; hobby designers, artists, and researchers can
turn their ideas and creations into solid plastic parts. There
is notable interest in creating toys, accessories for personal
electronics or sometimes even replacements for broken parts.
3.4 Biopolymers Used for 3D Printing
Diff erent biopolymers have been studied as materials for the
development of devices printed in 3D to be used in medical
applications, such as chitosan, alginate, and collagen, among others
[2, 28]. Other than biopolymers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly-
L-lactide acid (PLLA) are the widely used synthetic polymers in
the biomedical field [29].
However, not all polymeric materials are applicable and
suitable for all manufacturing methods. For example, molding
methods are inappropriate for developing medical implants from
Biopolymers Used for 3D Printing 59
hydrogels. Because, the biomaterial cannot be removed without
damaging both internal and external architecture, which will
most likely cause the implant breakage [29].
Another factor to consider is the degradation rate of the
biomaterial, since it is desired that the material degrade once its
function is accomplished, which would avoid a second operation
on the individuals to remove the implant. In this context, the
biodegradation rate of PLLA is too low to match the tissue
regeneration process after implantation. Besides, the acidic
degradation products of PLLA, such as lactic acid, tend to cause
aseptic inflammation in tissue [29]. On the contrary, PCL has the
presence of hydrolytic aliphatic–ester bonds, which are unstable.
Therefore, its degradation duration can be as long as 24 months
for being completely degraded. Thus, PCL is always used to co-
polymerize with other materials to have desired degradation
properties [1]. So, PCL has a better degradation rate to make
long-term implants and controlled-drug-release implants. In this
sense, Honda et al. [30] used poly(L-lactide-ε-caprolactone) as a
biodegradable sponge and implanted it into a nude mice. After a
4-week experimental process, the result showed that there was
the formation of cartilage-like structures in the construct [1].
Additionally, polymers can be chemically modified to match
the rate of tissue regeneration and degradation rate of the
material as well as to obtain a wide range of properties for
biomedical applications, such as mechanical properties, diff usivity,
density, and hydrophilicity. In addition, these may have optimal
control over specific cellular interactions with the polymer
material, whereby cells are comfortable, interacting with
proteins that bind to the surface of the material, particularly
biopolymers [29].
On the other hand, the combination of more than one
biomaterial provides better characteristics than any single type
of biomaterial, which in turn leads to the development of
composite polymeric materials [29]. In this context, composite
polymers as 3D printing materials have been used to improve
implant–tissue biocompatibility, i.e., they will not be rejected by
the body upon implantation [2]. For example, Inzana et al. [31]
developed osseous implants from polymer blends of collagen
and Tween 80 using calcium phosphate as a natural filler with
60 3D Printing of Biopolymers
the aim of improving osteointegration and improving the
mechanical properties of the implant [31]. However, the
development of these materials requires high temperatures
that prevent the incorporation of bioactive molecules and drugs
during the 3D printing process, which could stimulate bone
regeneration or combat infections [31].
The feasibility of 3D printing of composite biopolymers at
low temperature has also been demonstrated from low-melting-
point matrices [2, 31]. This has allowed the incorporation of drugs,
cells, and 3D printing of synthetic or biological polymers such as
collagen, thus allowing the development of bioactive implants
[2]. Type I collagen is the most abundant structural protein in the
human body and is a critical component of bone extracellular
matrix, where it plays important roles in this mineralized tissue’s
strength and toughness. It has been shown that incorporating
collagen into mineralized bone cements could enhance their
biomechanical properties, as well as their osteoconductive and
osteoinductive characteristics. For example, collagen incorporation
into hand-mixed calcium phosphate cements has been shown to
improve cellular attachment, viability, proliferation, and activity
as well as mechanical properties. Advantages of 3D printing over
molding or paste injection include patient-specific geometries
and controlled spatial patterning of drugs or polymers within the
scaff old [31].
3.5 Advantages of 3D Printing for Medical
Applications
3D printing technology off ers significant advantages for medical
applications due to the ability to manufacture low-volume or
one-of-a-kind parts on-demand based on patient-specific needs.
For example, surgical implants are currently manufactured by
making a near-net-shape part via forging, casting, or machining
operations, followed by specialized surface finishing or treatments
for the desired surface, mechanical properties, and aesthetic
eff ects, as shown in Fig. 3.2. These operations require expensive
tooling; therefore, patient-specific or one-of-a-kind implants are
costly and are rarely used. Other challenges such as difficulty in
machining of titanium alloys due to high strength, low modulus of
Advantages of 3D Printing for Medical Applications 61
elasticity, and low thermal conductivity compared with steel
makes it more expensive to manufacture patient-specific
implants from these materials [32]. Finally, CM technologies can
be energy intensive, producing significant amounts of material
waste, and are not capable of easily producing implants with
functional gradation.
3D printing or AM represents a new option for the
production of a variety of biomedical devices such as orthopedic
implants. Although AM may require final machining, the AM-
based approach allows significant flexibility toward manufacturing
customized, low-volume, complex implants. Figure 3.2 compares
CM of implants with AM. AM provides geometrical freedom to
designers without manufacturing constraints, leading to novel
lightweight designs and potentially reduced part counts for
medical implants. Specifically for medical implants, AM allows for
customized complex shaped functional implants and demand-
based manufacturing—which can off er a significant reduction in
cost and inventory. Since AM does not require any part specific
tooling, cost per part remains constant for AM. However, for
CM, there is always a fixed cost for tooling and dies, and therefore,
cost per part decreases as the volume of parts increases until
it reaches a minimum. Such cost analysis forms the basis and
rationale for the use of 3D printing or AM for biomedical devices.
Despite some noteworthy success, the construction of human
tissue or entire organs with 3D printing or AM continues to present
significant challenges [33–36]. From plastic surgery to cancer
treatment and from treatment of birth defects to prosthetics
for amputees—all areas of medicine are seeking breakthroughs
enabled by 3D printing to enhance quality of life or to help patients
live longer.
We present two examples that illustrate future possibilities.
Complex craniofacial titanium implants from computed tomography
images of a fractured skull, shown in Fig. 3.3, can be fabricated
directly using a laser-based AM technology, Laser Engineered
Net Shaping. In another example, shown in Fig. 3.4, TE scaff olds
for bone regeneration can be produced through SLS of
poly(caprolactone), a biocompatible and bioresorbable polymer,
and poly(caprolactone)–hydroxyapatite composites [37, 38].
Furthermore, the scaff olds can be produced with a priori
designed mechanical properties to match the desired mechanical
performance of the target bone tissue.

ASTM D638 and D695 test specimen geometries endowed with 1D, 2D,
and 3D orthogonal porous channels (placed on a 2 mm grid).
It is envisioned that application of 3D printing will
revolutionize the field of biomedical devices and TE due to its
inherent flexibility in manufacturing complex parts using various
materials. However, many challenges still remain, due to a lack
64 3D Printing of Biopolymers
of diff erent materials for use in any printer and the inability
to manufacture multicomponent structures using commercial
printers.
3.6 Current Challenges in 3D Printing of
Biomaterials
3.6.1 Achieving Target Material Properties and
Desired Architectures
By virtue of layer-by-layer additive fabrication, it is claimed that
3D printing provides “complexity for free,” allowing the physical
realization of complex 3D structures endowed with complex
internal and external architectures. However, every layer and
every interface between adjacent layers provides the opportunity
for the introduction of defects during 3D printing that can lead
to the failure of the part under the intended application conditions.
Some of the key challenges associated with 3D printing of
biomedical implants lie in achieving target mechanical properties,
durability, and designed architectures to satisfy both mechanical
and functional requirements. This is especially important in
load-bearing implants, where mechanical performance and
fatigue are critical. 3D printing technologies are being used to
produce permanent implants in metals, polymers, and ceramics.
The capabilities of these technologies in processing feedstock
materials such as titanium, poly(ether ether ketone), and
hydroxyapatite need to be well-characterized and documented
under diverse conditions both in vitro and in vivo.
The challenges increase when the implants are endowed
with intentionally designed or manufacturing-induced porous
architectures. The eff ective mechanical properties and failure
modes of such porous architectures need to be well understood
and integrated into implant design procedures to avoid
undesirable implant failure outcomes. Computational design
techniques validated with experimentally measured property
data need to be integrated into implant design procedures.
Additional challenges lie in the ability of 3D printing technologies
Current Challenges in 3D Printing of Biomaterials 65
to accurately produce desired porous architectures meeting
design intent. Often, the length scales associated with the
designed porous architectures (ranging from tens to hundreds of
microns) are beyond the resolution capability of the 3D printing
technology in use.
Finally, surface finish or surface roughness can be a critical
requirement as well. The inherent stair-stepped surface finish
from layer-by-layer fabrication or other material consolidation-
induced surface roughness artifacts prevalent in 3D printing are
often beneficial for cell anchoring, proliferation, and integration,
but in other cases, they can be highly detrimental due to the
inducement of foreign body reactions or due to the release of
particles into regions surrounding the implant. Thus, careful
attention has to be paid to understanding surface finish and
surface texture requirements as well as choosing appropriate
post-processing procedures to attain final desired surfaces in
biomaterials fabricated by 3D printing.
3.6.2 Clean and Sterile Manufacturing Environments
3D-printed biomaterials are being produced with the intention
of use in implants or in laboratory scale studies in bioengineering.
In either case, careful attention needs to be paid to the conditions
under which the feedstock material is produced, supplied,
processed, post-processed, and handled. The scale-up of 3D
printing technologies for biomaterials will require careful design
of clean manufacturing environments both inside and outside
the 3D printing platforms to ensure the avoidance of material
contamination and related possible infections. Thus, the design
of 3D printing equipment for biomaterials needs to ensure
that equipment subsystems can meet the requirements for
contamination control, perhaps similar to or even more stringent
than those applied in the medical device industry. Furthermore,
clean manufacturing environments will need to be designed
from the ground up for scale-up manufacturing of 3D-printed
biomaterials. New sterilization, packaging, and shipping
procedures for 3D-printed biomaterials need to be developed
to ensure product integrity at the point of use.
66 3D Printing of Biopolymers
3.6.3 Concerns Related to Regulatory Issues
Regulatory issues are specific to a particular country and should
be checked for that particular region first. In the United States,
medical devices are classified under three categories based on
the risk to the patient: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Class I devices
are typically the lowest risk (e.g., a tongue depressor). If there is a
predicate device, then many devices are classified under Class II,
where the new device is substantially equivalent to the previous
device, which has already been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. Regulatory paths for the Class III or high-risk
devices are quite challenging as well as time-consuming. In most
cases, regulation follows technology development, and therefore,
many times there is a lag in appropriate regulations for certain
types of devices.
This is the case for 3D printing and its applications to human
health. Although the technology for patient-specific implants
is available, no clear regulatory path is established toward
immediate utilization of this technology. This is also because
the risk associated with the use of this technology is yet to
be fully understood and evaluated. A TE graft with tailored
porosity and chemistry can be fabricated in hours; however, the
scientific factors that need to be verified to confirm that this will
perform the same way as before are still evolving. Moreover,
the advent of diff erent 3D printing technologies is also making
this evaluation more complex. Finally, the needs of specific
patients are diff erent. A clear understanding of the biomechanical
and biological issues for diff erent parts will eventually help
develop regulatory pathways for diverse clinical applications
of 3D-printed parts. A logical approach will establish regulatory
paths for low-risk devices, such as specialty surgical tools, and
then slowly move toward the high-risk devices such as
patient-matched implants. It is envisioned that such trends will
follow in the coming years in the United States as well as other
parts of the world.
3.6.4 Material-Specific Machines
Unlike CM processes such as forging or investment casting,
many 3D printing processes are diff erent in terms of the materials
that can be used and the delivery of materials. For example,
Current Challenges in 3D Printing of Biomaterials 67
a polymer-based 3D printing process will not work for metals or
ceramics and vice versa. This makes process optimization very
important for diff erent materials that will be used with a specific
printer. The user must know what material will be used and
what kind of resolution is needed before selecting a 3D printer.
This limitation is the main reason why diff erent companies have
multiple 3D printers for a variety of applications.
3.6.5 Future Trends
3D printing of multi-material structures is one of the most
promising future trends. Diff erent materials at diff erent locations
in a structure can off er properties that cannot be achieved using
monolithic structures. These materials can only be bonded to
each other or alloyed during the part building, allowing for
compositional variations in the part. For 3D-printed biomaterials,
a simple example can help us understand the power of multi-
material 3D printing. For total hip prosthesis, implants are made
with either Ti Al V or CoCrMo alloys. To enhance bone–tissue
6 4
integration, implants are sometimes coated with porous Ti or Ta
metal or calcium phosphate-based ceramics. However, diff erent
processing strategies are utilized for the addition of coatings.
Using multi-material 3D printing, a calcium phosphate or metal
coated hip stem can be directly manufactured from the same
machine that can also produce an uncoated sample in the very next
run. Therefore, in addition to flexibility in design modifications,
the potential of incorporating compositional variations will allow
future innovations in advanced materials and structures using
3D printing.
For bioprinting, multi-material structures include cells that
can be printed along with organic or inorganic materials to
make a fully functional scaff old for TE [39]. Such an approach is
gaining considerable attention from a number of researchers,
though there are many challenges that need careful attention.
For example, cell viability will be key for successful bioprinting
operation. Shelf-life of materials with and without cells is
another significant issue. Also, due to significant variation in the
stiff ness of the cells and materials to be deposited, careful process
optimization is necessary to build scaff olds that can be used for
further in vitro or in vivo analysis.
68 3D Printing of Biopolymers
Another important criterion is vascularization or new blood
vessel network formation, commonly known as angiogenesis.
Figure 3.5 shows new blood vessel formation in 3D-printed-doped
tricalcium phosphate TE scaff olds in a rat distal femur model.
3D-printed TE scaff olds should support angiogenesis for
functional tissue formation to enhance healing in vivo [40–46].
Figure 3.5 New blood vessel formation in 3D-printed-doped tricalcium
phosphate TE scaff olds implanted in a rat distal femur model.
Finally, 3D printing combined with drug or protein delivery
is becoming popular and is expected to gain more attention in
the future. Drug-/protein-loaded biomaterials with a controlled
delivery option can be used to treat many diseases [45]. In particular,
specific drug combinations that are patient-matched and unique
can be loaded into a single 3D-printed drug delivery device.
However, drug–material and drug–drug interactions during 3D
printing are complex topics and will require significant process
optimization before actual applications can be realized and
approved for patient use.
3.7 Conclusion
The processing of biopolymers and polymer composites through
three-dimensional (3D) printing has been gaining a lot of
attention, because of its multiple applications in a wide variety
References 69
of industries. In fact, the exploration of the areas of applicability
of this technique remains an active area of research. With the
latest 3D printers capable of printing materials with a widely
contrasting mechanical behavior and with complex geometries
at micrometer resolutions, the potential of this technology
has grown. This technology now off ers the possibility of creating
complex topologies with fine features, composed of a multitude
of materials with variable mechanical properties on a large
scale, thus allowing the manufacture of devices with an
unprecedented multifunctional performance [47, 48]. Particularly
in medical applications, in the last decade there has been a growing
interest in the development of medical systems with bioactive
properties, which have been possible thanks to the technological
development of 3D printing as well as biopolymers, drugs,
natural fillers and implementation in vitro or in vivo of cells in
the formulated materials, which have generated a series of
implants with outstanding mechanical properties and exceptional
biocompatibility, adjusted to the exact dimensions of each implant
for each patient. Likewise, because of the greater surface area
of these devices, the cells are able to regenerate the tissues at
a faster rate, thus allowing the patients to recover quickly, and
avoiding a subsequent operation to remove the implant, since
these implants are degraded in the time, while this one fulfills
the mission for which it was developed. Finally, this type of
implant also promises to be a controlled-drug-release device,
while the polymer material used is degraded.
