Introduction\nTissue engineering is fundamentally described as the generation of three- dimensional (3D)\nartificial tissues", ". Introduction\nTissue engineering is fundamentally described as the generation of three- dimensional (3D)\nartificial tissues. Its consequential task is to regenerate human tissue or to develop cell-based\nsubstitutes in order to restore, reconstruct or improve tissue functions (Pörtner et al., 2005;\nEllis, 2005). Proper processing of biological and mechanical functionality is monumental for\ntissue engineered structures, the ones which are not mainly sufficient enough yet", ". Acquiring\nthe solution for this problem demands intensive researches and studies in every aspects and\nsteps of TE (Sengers et al., 2007)", ". As a matter of fact, creating a functional tissue requires\nefficient growth of various types of cells on a 3D scaffolds and the bulk production of one\ncell seems not to be adequate (Ellis et al., 2005).\nThe principal function of a scaffold is to direct cell behavior such as migration, proliferation,\ndifferentiation, maintenance of phenotype, and apoptosis by facilitating sensing and\nresponding to the environment via cell–matrix and cell–cell communications (Tabesh et al.,\n2009)", ". Therefore, having such abilities provides scaffolds seeded with a special type of cell as\nan important part of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The scaffold design and\nfabrication are major areas of biomaterial research, since biomaterial scaffold can create\nsubstrate within which cells are instructed to form a tissue or an organ in a highly controlled\nway. In this chapter, it is tried to provide an inclusive survey of biopolymers to be used as\nscaffolds for tissue engineering, fabrication methods and engineering challenges such as\nmass transfer and mechanical strength", ". In the proceeding, these factors are reviewed in\nvascular and nerve systems.\n2. Scaffold considerations\n2.1 Requirements of appropriate scaffold materials for tissue engineering\nScaffold design and fabrication are major areas of biomaterial research and they are also\nimportant areas for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine research", ". Scaffold\nprovides the necessary support for cells to proliferate and maintain their differentiated\nfunctions, and its architecture defines the ultimate shape of a new organ.\nAn ideal scaffold should possess the following characteristics to bring about the desired\nbiological response (1) the scaffold should possess inter-connecting pores of appropriate", "--- Page 2 ---\n154 Biomaterials Science and Engineering\nscale to favor tissue integration and vascularization, (2) be made from material with\ncontrolled biodegradability or bio-resorbability, (3) appropriate surface chemistry to favor\ncellular attachment, differentiation and proliferation, (4) possess adequate mechanical\nproperties to match the intended site of implantation and handling, (5) should not induce\nany adverse response and, (6) be easily fabricated into a variety of shapes and sizes (Liu et\nal., 2007; Sachlos et al., 2003).", "any adverse response and, (6) be easily fabricated into a variety of shapes and sizes (Liu et\nal., 2007; Sachlos et al., 2003).\nDue to control scaffold degradation and mechanical integrity, cell-scaffold interaction as\nwell as cell functon, one must have access to a range of materials", ". Therefore, an appropriate\nfabrication method is required with which it is possible to have a structure with different\nindependent parameters and materials (Yarlagadda et al., 2005).\nIt is worth to mention that degradation of synthetic polymers, both in vitro and in vivo\nconditions, releases by-products. For example, for PLLA releasing Lactic acid during\ndegradation, causes reducing the pH, which further accelerates the degradation rate due to\nautocatalysis which later affects cellular function", ". (Sachlos & Czernuszka, 2003, as cited\nReed and Gilding, 1981)\nIn addition to degradation rate and by-products, certain physical characteristics of the\nscaffolds must be considered when designing a substrate to be used in tissue engineering\napplications. For instance, in order to allow proper cell attachment, the scaffold must have a\nlarge surface area which can be achieved by creating a highly porous polymeric foam", ". In\nthese foams, the pore size should be large enough to allow cells to penetrate through the\npores, to maximize nutrient and oxygen diffusion, interstitial fluid and blood flow into the\ninterior of the scaffold, to manipulate tissue differentiation (Yarlagadda et al., 2005, as cited\nLe Huec et al. 1995; Tsuruga et al., 1997). These characteristics (porosity and pore size) often\ndepend on the material and method of scaffold fabrication (Mikos&Temenoff, 2000, as cited\nMooney et al., 1999; Nam et al", ". 2000)\n2.2 Decent materials for scaffolds fabrication\nIn order to have an effective function, an ideal scaffold must possess the optimum structural\nparameters, conductivity to the cellular activities leading to neo-tissue formation; these\ninclude cell penetration and migration into the scaffold, cell attachment onto the scaffold\nsubstrate, cell spreading and proliferation and cell orientation. Such scaffold design\nparameters are now described with reference to these cellular activities", ". One of the first\nconsiderations when designing a scaffold for tissue engineering is the choice of material.\nThe three main material types which have been successfully investigated to be applied in\ndeveloping scaffolds include (i) natural polymers, (ii) synthetic polymers, and (iii) ceramics\n(Willerth & Sakayama-Elbert, 2007; Radulescu et al., 2007).\n2.2.1 Natural materials\nNatural polymers commonly derived from protein or carbohydrate polymers have been\nused as scaffolds for the growth of several tissue types", ". In the area of tissue engineering, for\nexample, scientists and engineers look for scaffolds on which it may successfully grow cells\nto replace damaged tissue. Typically, it is desirable for these scaffolds to be: biodegradable,\nnon-toxic/non-inflammatory, mechanically similar to the tissue to be replaced, highly\nporous, encouragement of cell attachment and growth, easy and cheap to manufacture, and\ncapable of attaching with other molecules (Elmstedt, 2006; Cuy, 2004). Here some examples\nof natural polymers that have been previously studied for biomaterials application are\nreviewed.", "--- Page 3 ---\nThe Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 155\n- Collagen\nCollagen is considered by many scientists as an ideal scaffold or matrix for tissue\nengineering as it is the major protein component of the extracellular matrix. It provides\nsupport to connective tissues such as skin, tendons, bones, cartilage, blood vessels, and\nligaments in its native environment, and also interacts with cells in connective tissues and\ntransduces essential signals for the regulation of cell anchorage, migration, proliferation,\ndifferentiation, and survival", ". Collagen is defined by high mechanical strength, good\nbiocompatibility, low antigenicity and ability of being cross-linked, and tailored for its\nmechanical degradation and water uptake properties; Twenty-seven types of collagens have\nbeen identified so far, but collagen type I is the most abundant and the most investigated for\nbiomedical applications (Chunlin et al., 2004).\nCollagen may also be processed into a variety of formats including porous sponges, gels,\nand sheets. It can be cross-linked with chemicals to make it stronger or to alter its\ndegradation rate (Cuy, 2004)", ".

However, for medical applications, the implantation of foreign\ncells causes immunological problems", ". However, for medical applications, the implantation of foreign\ncells causes immunological problems. Collagen has potential uses as follows (Matin, 2004):\n- Collagen gel matrix maintains its shape following cell seeding and culture,\n- Highly permeable bio-scaffold design,\n- Production of tissue implants for reconstructive/cosmetic surgery applications, and\n- Generation of spinal cord repair implants.\n- Chitosan\nChitosan is a cationic polymer obtained from chitin comprising copolymers of β (1→4)-\nglucosamine and N-acetyl- D-glucosamine", ". Chitin is a natural polysaccharide found\nparticularly in the shell of crustacean, cuticles of insects and cell walls of fungi and is the\nsecond most abundant polymerized carbon found in nature (Khor & Lim, 2003).\nThis polymer has many suitable properties. It can be used for wound dressing, drug\ndelivery, and tissue engineering (cartilage, nerve and liver tissue) applications", ". These\nproperties include: (Willerth et al., 2007):\n- Minimal foreign body reaction,\n- Mild processing conditions (synthetic polymers often need to be dissolved in harsh\nchemicals; chitosan will dissolve in water based on pH),\n- Controllable mechanical/biodegradation properties (such as scaffold porosity or\npolymer length), and\n- Availability of chemical side groups for attachment to other molecules.\nChitosan has already been investigated for adoption in the engineering of cartilage, nerve,\nand liver tissue", ". Current difficulties applying chitosan as a polymer scaffold in tissue\nengineering include low strength and inconsistent behavior with seeded cells (Madihally\nand Matthew, 1999). Fortunately, chitosan may be easily combined with other materials in\norder to increase its strength and cell-attachment potential. Mixtures with synthetic\npolymers such as poly (vinyl alcohol) and poly (ethylene glycol), or natural polymers such\nas collagen, have already been produced", ". These combinations promise improving the\nperformance of the combined construct over the behavior of either component alone (Cuy,\n2004).\n- Agarose/alginate\nAgarose and alginate are linear polysaccharides obtained from seaweed and algae,\nrespectively. Both polygosaccharides must undergo extensive purification to prevent\nimmune responses after implantation (Willerth et al., 2007). Moreover, encapsulation of\ncertain cell types into alginate beads may actually enhance cell survival and growth. In", "--- Page 4 ---\n156 Biomaterials Science and Engineering\naddition, alginate has been explored to function in liver, nerve, heart, and cartilage tissue\nengineering.\nUnfortunately some drawbacks to alginate include mechanical weakness and poor cell\nadhesion. In order to overcome these limitations, the strength and cell behavior of alginate\nhave been enhanced by mixtures with other materials, including the natural polymers\nagarose and Chitosan (Cuy, 2004). Mohan et al. described the preparation and\ncharacterization of alginate sponges to be used as scaffolds in tissue engineering", ".

They\nfabricated highly porous 3D scaffolds from cheaply available sodium alginate, which\nexhibits good biocompatibility. The scaffold fabricated by a combination of freeze drying\nand particulate leaching, showed increased porosity and pore size", ". The scaffold fabricated by a combination of freeze drying\nand particulate leaching, showed increased porosity and pore size. Better pore\ncharacteristics and swelling properties may permit more cell invasion and nutrient supply.\nMoreover alginate is thermally stable, non-cytotoxic and biodegradable (Mohan and Nair,\n2005).\n- Fibronectin\nFibronectin (FN) is a glycoprotein which exists outside cells and on the cell surface. It also\nexists in blood, other body fluids and on the cell surfaces of connective tissue", ". It also\nexists in blood, other body fluids and on the cell surfaces of connective tissue. This protein\nassociates with the other proteins of the extra cellular matrix (ECM) like fibrinogen,\ncollagen, glycosaminoglycans and with suitable receptors which are in the cell membrane\n(Ebner et al., 2006)", ". Fibronectin is composed of tandem repeats of three distinct types (I, II\nand III) of individually folded modules.\n2.2.2 Synthetic materials\nSynthetic polymers have been widely used for over 20 years as surgical sutures, with long\nestablished clinical success and many are approved for human use by the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA)", ". The polymers which approved by FDA are as follows: PCL, PLLA,\nPLGA, PEG and PGA.\nHowever current synthetic polymers do not possess a surface chemistry which is familiar to\ncells, that in vivo thrive on an extracellular matrix made mostly of collagen, elastin,\nglycoproteins, proteoglycans, laminin and fibronectin; these materials have many\nadvantages to be used as scaffolds (Sachlos & Czernuszka, 2003, as cited Alberts et al., 1994).\nThese polymers can be tailored to produce a wide range of mechanical properties and\ndegradation rates", ". Synthetic polymers also represent a more reliable source of raw materials\nwith the ability to provoke an immune response in body. Finally synthetic polymers can be\nreact together to combine their unique properties (Willerth et al., 2007; Manzanedo, 2005).\nHere some of these synthetic polymers used in tissue engineering are described briefly.\n- Poly (D, L- lactic acid)\nPoly lactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable polyester attainable by poly-condensation of lactic\nacid, and amonomeric precursor that can be obtained from renewable resources", ". Lactic acid\nis a chiral molecule available in the L and D stereoisomer forms.

L-lactic acid occurs in the\nmetabolism of all animals and microorganism, and thus is an absolutely non-toxic\ndegradation product of polylactides. This is proved by the successful application of\npolylactides as a resorbable medical structure over a period of three decades (kricheldorf,\n2001; Onose, 2008).\nSince this polymer has biodegradability, biocompatibility, good mechanical properties, and\nability to be dissolved in common solvents for processing, it has been successfully employed\nas matrixes for cell transplantation and tissue regenerations (Kim et al., 2003).", "--- Page 5 ---\nThe Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 157\n- Poly (lactic-co- glycolic acid)\nPoly (glycolic acid) (PGA) and poly (lactic acid) (PLA) are biodegradable synthetic\npolymers, which can react to form the copolymer poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). PGA\nis highly crystalline and has a high melting point and low solubility in organic solvents", ". PGA\nis highly crystalline and has a high melting point and low solubility in organic solvents. An\nintensive investigation aimed at the improvement of PGA properties was undertaken by\nmany researchers, focusing on the preparation of PGA copolymers with more hydrophilic\nPLA.\nAfter implantation, the ester bonds that make up the backbone of the polymer can be\nhydrolyzed, causing the scaffold to degrade into metabolite by-products. These by-products\ncan be absorbed by the body and may cause pH changes around the implantation site", ". These by-products\ncan be absorbed by the body and may cause pH changes around the implantation site. The\ndegradation rate of the scaffolds can be altered by varying the ratio of PGA to PLA in the\nscaffold.\nThe presence of an extra methyl group renders lactic acid more hydrophobic. The\nhydrophobicity of PLA limits the water uptake of films to 2%, and decreases the backbone\nhydrolysis rate in respect to the one of the PGA homopolymer. Moreover, PLA is more\nsoluble in organic solvents than in PGA", ". Moreover, PLA is more\nsoluble in organic solvents than in PGA. It is important to note that no linear relationship\nexists between the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid and the physico-mechanical properties\nof their regarding copolymers. The high crystallinity of PGA is rapidly lost in PGA/PLA\ncopolymers", ". The high crystallinity of PGA is rapidly lost in PGA/PLA\ncopolymers. These morphological changes lead to an increase in the hydration and\nhydrolysis rate and copolymers tend to degrade more rapidly than the homopolymers of\nPGA or PLA do (Reed et al., 1981).\n- Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate\nPoly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a linear head-to-tail homopolymer of (R)-β hydroxybutiric\nacid, which forms crystalline cytoplasmic granules in the wide variety of bacteria", ". This\nmaterial is biodegradable and biocompatible microbially produced polyester, which after\nimplantation degrades slowly at body temperature and forms a non-toxic metabolite that is\nsecreted in urine (Mosahebi et al., 2001)", ". PHB has been previously used as a wound\nscaffolding device, designed to support and protect a wound against further damage while\npromoting healing by encouraging cellular growth on and within the device from the\nwound surface (Ljungberg et al., 1999).\n- Poly-e-caprolactone\nPoly-e-caprolactone(PCL), an aliphatic polyester which is bioresorbable and biocompatible,\nis generally used in pharmaceutical products and wound dressings (Venugopal et al., 2005).\nThis polymer has low melting point of around 60°C and a glass transition temperature of\nabout −60°C", ". PCL is degraded by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in physiological conditions\n(e.g. in the human body) and therefore, has received a great deal of attention for use as an\nimplantable biomaterial (Schnell et al., 2007).\n- Poly (ethylene glycol)\nPoly ethylene glycol (PEG), also known as poly ethylene oxide (PEO) or polyoxyethylene\n(POE) is the most commercially important polyethers, which refers to an oligomer or polymer\nof ethylene oxide resisting protein adsorption and cell adhesion. These characteristics help\nminimize the immune response after implantation", ". These characteristics help\nminimize the immune response after implantation. Additionally, this polymer can also help to\nseal cell membranes after injury, making it useful for limiting cell death. Hydrophilic PEG\nhydrogels can be made through a variety of cross- linking schemes to create scaffolds with\nvarying degradation as well as release rates. Further chemistry can be used to modify these\ngels to add sites for cell adhesion or extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules to allow cells to\ninfiltrate into these scaffolds, extending their potential applications (Willerth et al., 2007).", "--- Page 6 ---\n158 Biomaterials Science and Engineering\nPEG can be photo-polymerized under mild conditions in the presence of cells to create a\nhydrogel that is biocompatible and non-toxic", ". Bioactive molecules such as cell adhesion\nligands, growth factors and proteolytic degradation sites have been previously incorporated\ninto PEG hydrogels and shown to influence adhesion, proliferation, migration, and\nextracellular matrix production of vascular smooth muscle cells.\n- Poly (glycerol sebacic acid)\nPoly glycerol sebacic acid (PGS), also called bio-rubber, is a tough, biodegradable elastomer\nmade from biocompatible monomers. Its main features are good mechanical properties,\nrubber like elasticity and surface erosion biodegradation", ". Its main features are good mechanical properties,\nrubber like elasticity and surface erosion biodegradation. PGS was proved to have similar in\nvitro and in vivo biocompatibility to PLGA, a widely used biodegradable polymer.\n(Manzanedo, 2005; Sundback et al., 2005).\n- Poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)\nHydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) is a hydro-soluble monomer, which can be\npolymerized (under various circumstances) at low temperatures (from -20°C to +10°C). It\ncan be used to prepare various hydrogels and to immobilize proteins or cells", ". It\ncan be used to prepare various hydrogels and to immobilize proteins or cells. It is widely\nused in medicine as an appropriate biomaterial. Poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)\n(pHEMA) is particularly attractive for biomedical engineering applications. Because of its\nphysical properties and high biocompatibility, this polymer can be easily manipulated\nthrough formulated chemistry has been extensively used in medical applications, e.g.\ncontact lenses, kerato prostheses and orbital implants", ". Furthermore, a pHEMA scaffold\ncould be easily incorporated into the nerve guidance tubes (Flynn et al., 2003).\n2.3 Methods used for scaffolds design\nSeveral techniques have been developed to process synthetic and natural scaffold materials\ninto porous structures. These conventional scaffold fabrication techniques are considered as\nprocesses that create scaffolds having a continuous, uninterrupted pore structure", ". An\noverview of such different techniques is as follows: Electrospinning, Solvent-casting,\nparticulate-leaching, Gas foaming, Fiber meshes/fiber bonding, Phase separation, Melt\nmolding, Emulsion freeze drying, Solution casting and Freeze drying (Mikos& Temenoff,\n2003; Sachlos & Czernuszka, 2003).\n2.3.1 Electrospinning\nElectrospinning is a technique for nano-fibrous scaffold fabrication", ". Various synthetic or\nnatural polymers can be spun to nano fibers with diameters in nano - to micrometer range.\nThey are characterized by a high surface to volume ratio and thus offer sample substrate for\ncell attachment.\nIn this technique, polymers are dissolved into a proper solvent or melted before being\nsubjected to a very high voltage to overcome the surface tension and viscoelastic forces as\nwell as forming different fibers (50 nm - 30 µm) diameters, which feature a morphologic\nsimilarity to the extracellular matrix of natural tissue and effective mechanical properties.", "similarity to the extracellular matrix of natural tissue and effective mechanical properties.\nThese nanofibrous scaffolds can be utilized to provide a better environment for cell\nattachment, migration, proliferation and differentiation when compared with traditional\nscaffolds (Martins et al., 2007).\nIn general, the process of electrospinning is mainly affected by (i) system parameters, such as\npolymer molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and solution properties (e.g.\nviscosity, surface tension, conductivity); and (ii) process parameters, such as flow rate, electric", "viscosity, surface tension, conductivity); and (ii) process parameters, such as flow rate, electric\npotential, distance between capillary and collector, motion of collector, etc (Yang et al., 2005).", "--- Page 7 ---\nThe Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 159\nA study on the fabrication of a scaffold by electrospinning biomaterials such as poly lactic\nacid (PLA), poly glycolic acid (PGA), poly (ethylene-co- vinyl acetate) (PEVA), and type-I\ncollagen was reported (Bowlin et al., 2001)", ". Moreover, nanostructured electrospun PLGA\nmembranes for anti-adhesion applications were presented (Fang et al., 2001).\nElectrospinning can even be used to create biocompatible thin films with useful coating\ndesigns and surface structures that can be deposited on implantable devices in order to\nfacilitate the integration of these devices with the body (Buchko et al., 1999).\nThe collagen nanofibers were characterized by a wide range of pore size distribution, high\nporosity, excellent mechanical strength and high surface area to volume ratios, which are", "porosity, excellent mechanical strength and high surface area to volume ratios, which are\nfavorable parameters for cell attachment, growth and proliferation", ". In cell activity\nassessment, electrospun collagen nanofibers coated with type I collagen or laminin were\nfound to promote cell adhesion and spread of normal human keratinocytes. This may be a\nconsequence of the high surface area available for cell attachment due to their three-\ndimensional features and restoration of biological and structural properties of natural ECM\nproteins (Rho et al., 2006).\n2.3.2 Freeze-drying\nMany of the fabrication technologies for polymers are based on particulate-leaching\ntechniques, heat compression, and extrusion", ". However, the harsh operating conditions of\nthese processes may limit the incorporation of bioactive proteins, cells and residual amounts\nof the chemical solvents required may cause toxicity in vivo. Freeze-drying is an alternative\nmethod to produce porous scaffolds, which do not require additional chemicals relying on\nthe water.\nThis method, used in hydrogels, forms ice crystals that can be sublimated from the polymer,\ncreating a particular micro-architecture", ". Because the direction of growth and size of the ice\ncrystals are a function of the temperature gradient, linear, radial, and/or random pore\ndirections and diverse sizes can be produced with this methodology (Stokols et al., 2004).\nOn the other hand, the pore size can be controlled by the freezing rate and pH; a fast\nfreezing rate produces smaller pores (Sachlos et al., 2003).\n2.3.3 Molding\nGraft implants manufacture is an extraordinary example of micro-architecture. One possible\nway of making the grafts is the particulate leaching technique (i.e. molding)", ". One possible\nway of making the grafts is the particulate leaching technique (i.e. molding). A mold is\nmade of a medium that may not contaminate the graft and that may melt off at a lower\ntemperature melt point than that of the graft. Already widely used, this method limits\ndesign intricacy because heat stress during formation compromises the composition of the\ngraft (Friedman et al., 2002). Another problem with this method is that it would be difficult\nto make a mold small enough for small animal research. As an example, Moore et al", ". Another problem with this method is that it would be difficult\nto make a mold small enough for small animal research. As an example, Moore et al. used\nPoly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with copolymer ratio 85:15 for their initial experiments.\nInjection molding with rapid solvent evaporation resulted in scaffolds with a plurality of\ndistinct channels running parallel along the length of the scaffolds (Moore et al., 2006).\n2.3.4 Solid free form fabrication\nThe most promising production method is called solid free-form fabrication (SFF)", ". This\napproach uses a machine like an inkjet printer to make the graft one layer at time by\n“printing” one layer on top of the other (Friedman et al., 2002). However, the main problem", "--- Page 8 ---\n160 Biomaterials Science and Engineering\nwith this technology is the extremely high cost. The machines have to be permanently\nmodified from their original function. Through these methods one can manage pore size,\nporosity and pore distribution to produce structures to increase the mass transport of\noxygen and nutrients throughout the scaffold.\nAlthough there are several commercial variants of SFF technology, the general process\ninvolves producing a computer-generated model using computer-aided design (CAD)\nsoftware", ". After expression of cross- sectional layers, data is implemented to the SFF machine\nto produce the physical model. Through building the layers from bottom to up, each newly\nformed layer adheres to the previous. Post-processing may be required to remove\ntemporary support structures (Sachlos & Czernuszka, 2003). The methods that use the SSF\ntechnologies to fabricate tissue engineering scaffold are: (1) stereolithography (SLA), (2)\nselective laser sintering (SLS), (3) fused deposition modelling (FDM) and (4) three-\ndimensional printing (3-DP).\n3", ". Challenges in engineering scaffolds\nThe major hindrance through tissue engineering constructs is mass transfer. Since scaffolds\nprovide large surface area to volume ratios, it is proved that mass transfer limitation is\nreduced. Pore interconnectivity directly influences the mass transfer (e.g. oxygen and\nnutrient supply and removal of toxic metabolites).\nDuring tissue regeneration, permeability of the matrix decreases due to the declined pore\nsize", ". In addition, the size of most engineered tissues is limited as they do not have their own\nblood system, and the cells are only supplied by diffusion (Griffith & Naughton, 2002;\nKannan et al., 2005). Meanwhile, as only cell layers of 100–200 μm thickness can absorb O\n2\nby diffusion, oxygen supply is particularly a critical issue. However, since tissue\nconstructions should have larger dimensions, mass transfer limitation can be considered as\none of the greatest engineering challenges (Pörtner et al., 2005).\nThe next challenge is mechanical effect on cells in dynamic systems", ". Under flow conditions,\nflow rate needs to be optimized based on (i) nutrient distribution, (ii) effect on assembly of\nmatrix elements and (iii) cellular response to local shear stress (Lawrence et al., 2009). The\nscaffold architecture affects the local fluid flow velocities of the cell suspension which\ninfluences the number of cell-scaffold contacts per time unit and the local cell deposition\nrates", ". By changing the scaffolds design, different flow profiles and cell distributions in the\nscaffolds may be obtained (Melchels et al., 2011).\nAlthough flow of growth medium improves nutrient and waste transport, shear stresses\ninduced by fluid flow could affect the scaffold architecture as well as cellular alignment\nwithin the structures (Lawrence et al., 2009 as cited Gray et al., 1988; Huang et al., 2005).The\nwall shear rate determines the hydrodynamic force, that adhering cells are exposed to,\nwhich can be expressed per unit of area as the wall shear stress (in Pa), and is the product of", "which can be expressed per unit of area as the wall shear stress (in Pa), and is the product of\nthe wall shear rate and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid medium", ". The critical shear stress\nfor cell detachment has been found to range almost between 1 to 3 Pa that depends on the\nmaterial on which the cells are cultured", ". Also the highest cell densities in the scaffolds could\nbe observed in the regions with larger pores, higher fluid flow velocities and higher wall\nshear rates (Melchels et al., 2011 cited as Isenberg et al., 2006; Macario et al., 2008; Smith et\nal., 1995).\nIt has been seen that the pore size is a variable strongly affecting the predicted shear stress\nlevel, whereas the porosity only influence the statistical distribution of the shear stress", "--- Page 9 ---\nThe Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 161\n(Sadir, 2011). Furthermore, it has been showed that porosity and pore size affect pressure\ndrop which is important to be determined during tissue regeneration (Lawrence et al., 2009,\ncited as Sodian et al., 2000). For the same pore size with decreasing porosities, pressure drop\nincreases, and for the constant porosity with reducing pore size, which could limit the fluid\nflow and nutrient transport, pressure drop is increased (Sadir, 2011)", ". Here these challenges\nare investigated by the revision of two case studies.\n3.1 Vascular system\nThe primary functions of blood vessels are the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the\ntissues and organs of the body and removal of their respective metabolites for clearance or\nre-oxygenation (Boland et al., 2004).

The IMA\nwith elasticity maintains the ability to vasoregulate and is less prone to atherosclerosis (Wise\net al., 2011). Apart from the fact that implantation of native vessels is limited by the\nmismatch of dimensional and mechanical properties (Chung et al., 2010), the acceptable vein\nis not available in 30 %of patients (Boland et al., 2004).\nAn artery is composed of three layers having different matrix-tissue compositions", ". The\ninnermost lumen layer (intima) is composed of endothelial cells (ECs) on extracellular\nmatrixes such as type IV collagen and elastin, providing the necessary antithrombogenic\nnature for contact with the bloodstream. The middle layer (media) is usually the thickest of\nthe three layers and is composed of multiple layers of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within a\nsurrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of collagen types I and III, elastin fibers\nand various proteoglycans. The outermost layer (adventitia) is made of fibroblastic cells on\nrandomly arranged type I collagen", ". The outermost layer (adventitia) is made of fibroblastic cells on\nrandomly arranged type I collagen. In short the collagens impart tensile strength to the\nvessel wall while elastin provides the elasticity (Boland et al., 2004) (Thomas et al., 2007).\nWith respect to this construction, the combined structure is particularly attractive for\nvascular tissue engineering applications", ". By designing a multilayered tube, it is now\npossible to seed or co-culture different cell lines in layers with controlled orientation (Chung\net al., 2010).\nTissue engineering uses vascular cells and supporting scaffolds to build functional blood\nvessels (Tillman et al., 2009). In the domain of cells, both the EC and SMC are critical\ncomponents of a tissue engineered vascular graft", ". In the domain of cells, both the EC and SMC are critical\ncomponents of a tissue engineered vascular graft. ECs play an integral role in tissue\nhomeostasis, fibrinolysis, and anti-coagulation while SMCs perform many functions,\nincluding vasoconstriction and dilatation, synthesis of various types of collagen, elastin and\nproteoglycans (Ju et al., 2010). Bare scaffolds without ECs showed abundant platelet\nadherence, while scaffolds lined with ECs resisted adherence of blood elements", ". While it is\nevident that cells play a major role in achieving patent vessels, designing a vascular\nscaffolds that provide structural support, enabling cells to proliferate and growing into a\nthree-dimensional (3-D) tissue is important (Chung et al., 2010; Tillman et al., 2009)\nDeveloping scaffolds that can withstand the pulsatile nature, high pressure, and high flow\nrate of the bloodstream (Boland et al., 2004) is especially necessary in cardiovascular\napplications", ". The ideal vascular prostheses must be a presentation of its functional\ncharacters such as flexibility with kink resistance and biocompatibility (non-thrombogenic)", "--- Page 10 ---\n162 Biomaterials Science and Engineering\n(Boland et al., 2004)", ". Ability of ECs adherence to form an anti-thrombogenic luminal surface,\nand SMCs migration, exhibit vasoactive properties, (Williamson et al., 2006 cited as Tiwari\net al., 2001; Seifalian et al., 2002), capability of withstanding physiological hemodynamic\nforces while maintaining structural integrity until mature tissue forms in vivo (Ju et al.,\n2010), and also the compliance is matched with that of the native artery (Boland et al., 2004).\nAdditionally, providing interconnected pores, generating high porosity so as to promote", "Additionally, providing interconnected pores, generating high porosity so as to promote\ncell–cell and cell–matrix communication and having sufficient mechanical stability are key\nfactors (Chung et al., 2010) for the engineering of blood vessels", ". Small pore size does not\nbring about a problem for ECs but would limit the ability of SMCs to colonize the outer\nportion of neo- vessel. Several approaches have been proposed to generate large sized pores\nwhich include the use of the salt leaching technique (Ju et al., 2010, cited as Nam et al., 2007)\nand coelectrospinning with water-soluble polymers which serve as sacrificial fibers.\nResearchers indicated that a larger pore size can be achieved by increasing the fiber\ndiameter and that this would facilitate cell infiltration", ". They showed that the mechanical\nstrength of the scaffolds decreases as fiber diameter increases (Ju et al., 2010).\nOf the countless synthetic materials evaluated over the years, expanded poly tetrafluoro\nethylene (e-PTFE) and woven or knitted polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers have\nproven to be satisfactory in terms of medium (6-10 mm internal diameter (ID)) and large\n(>10 mm ID) vascular prosthetics, respectively (Boland et al., 2004)", ". However, clinical\nsuccess for small diameter (<6 mm) vessels has yet to be demonstrated due to complications\nsuch as occlusion, thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia (Chung, 2010).\nIn addition, biodegradable synthetic polymer scaffolds from polyglycolic acid (PGA), poly-\nL-lactic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates such as poly-4-hydroxybutyrate, polycaprolactone -\ncopolylactic acid and polyethylene glycol have been explored", ". On the other hand, natural\npolymers such as collagen and fibrin have also been utilized to construct biological vascular\ngrafts, populated and compacted by smooth muscle cells, and exhibiting high tensile\nstrength and flexibility (Zhang et al., 2008).\nHowever, future attempts are addressed as: (i) maufacture of scaffolds with ECM-like nano -\nfibrous structure; (ii) development of the electrospun structures to manage pore size which\nimproves the ingrowth of large sized cells; (iii) test the structural integrity of these scaffolds", "improves the ingrowth of large sized cells; (iii) test the structural integrity of these scaffolds\nduring degradation and under dynamic culture conditions (Vaz et al, 2005).\nIn some cases these materials have been coated with cell-adhesive proteins such as\nfibronectin, vitronectin and laminin to facilitate EC attachment, which effectively renders\nthe surface to become antithrombogenic However, such modifications can also provide\ngood substrates for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation", ". EC must be able to resist\ndetachment by the high shear forces exerted by blood flow and turbulence, thereby\nproviding an anti-thrombotic surface. They should also retain vasoactive function but not\ninduce immune reactions to the implant (Williamson et al., 2006, cited as Tiwari et al., 2001).\nBased on these results, Ku and Park. suggested that Poly dopamine (PDA) coating generally\nfacilitates the cell adhesion process of culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells\n(HUVECs) on electrospun PCL nanofibers", ". The increase of cell adhesion on this coated\nnanofibers are attributed to the adsorption/immobilization of serum proteins on PDA ad-\nlayer (Ku & Park, 2010).\nAs it was mentioned about vascular tissue construction, designing a multilayered tube is\nattractive to seed or co- culture different cell lines in layers with controlled orientation. Vaz\net al. fabricated a bi- layered tubular scaffold of PLA (outer layer) and PCL (inner layer) by\nmulti-layering electrospinning (ME) using a rotating mandrel-type collector. The tensile", "--- Page 11 ---\nThe Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 163\nmeasurements showed that PLA/PCL scaffolds presented a much lower elongation and a\nfour-fold increase of maximum stress compared to electrospun PCL ones. The PLA/PCL bi-\nlayered scaffold supported the attachment, spread and growth of mouse fibroblasts (Vaz et\nal, 2005).\nMorever, Venugopal et al. proved that PCL nanofibrous matrixes coated with collagen\nsupport cell growth or make the three-dimensional structured multilayer of PCL nanofibers\nand collagen nanofibers suitable for blood vessel engineering", ". Their report defines the initial\nadhesion mechanism of SMCs to the sebiocompatible poly (caprolactone) nanofibrous\nmatrixes coated with collagen. These results may be relevant to other cell types (Venugopal\net al., 2005c).\nWise et al. reported the production of synthetic human elastin and poly caprolactone\nmultilayered vascular graft which mimics the mechanical properties of the human IMA.\nThey showed that conduits constructed from synthetic elastin (SE) alone had insufficient\nstrength for vascular applications", ". This graft was systematically modified by addition of\nPCL, which was selected on the basis of its appropriate mechanical properties and a slow\ndegradation time. On the other hand, they found that PCL interacts with platelets, which\ncan contribute to thrombogenicity. For this reason, the graft lumen was made of pure SE i.e.\ndevoid of PCL to significantly reduce platelet adhesion, in contrast to PCL/collagen hybrids\nwhich showed abundant platelet adherence", ". It should also be mentioned that the outer layer\nof the graft, a hybrid of SE/PCL modulated the graft mechanic (Wise et al., 2011).\nOn the other hand, the nanolayer can mimic the ECM, whereas the micro layer provides\nlarger pores which facilitate superior cell infiltration; a micro - and nano-combined\nstructures can be advantageous.\nChung et al", ". combined electrospinning and melt spinning of poly (L-lactide-co-e-\ncaprolactone) (50:50 PLCL) to fabricate a multilayered tubular construct using a rotating\nmandrel for both techniques, which makes the nano layer able to adhere completely to the\nmicro layer. They showed that copolymers of PLCL exhibit a range of mechanical properties\nfrom rigid solids to elastomers, depending on their composition", ". They showed that copolymers of PLCL exhibit a range of mechanical properties\nfrom rigid solids to elastomers, depending on their composition. Furthermore, it has a slow\nrate of degradation compared to other bioresorbable polymers such as PGA and PLA\n(Chung et al., 2010).\nAdditionally, Surface patterns such as microgrooves have been successfully used to induce\nboth alignment of cell shape and directional cell migration. Uttayarat et al, incorporated\nboth electrospun microfibers and surface microgrooves in the fabrication of 3D synthetic\npolyurethane (PU) grafts", ". Uttayarat et al, incorporated\nboth electrospun microfibers and surface microgrooves in the fabrication of 3D synthetic\npolyurethane (PU) grafts. They found that grooved patterns induced the uniform alignment\nof endothelial cell monolayers with morphology similar to naturally aligned endothelium\nunder hemodynamic flow", ". They also extended these findings by demonstrating that a\ngroove depth or a fiber diameter of about 1 µm can guide the alignment of endothelial cells\ninside tubular PU grafts (Uttayarat et al., 2010).\n3.2 Nerve and spinal cord system\nThe nervous system is classified into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral\nnervous system (PNS). The CNS comprises the brain, spinal cord, optic, olfactory and\nauditory systems", ". The CNS comprises the brain, spinal cord, optic, olfactory and\nauditory systems. Considering these organs, the CNS comprises of a vast number of\nneurons, astroglia, microglia, and oligodendrocytes.\nThe spinal cord which is approximately 1 cm thick and 42 cm long has four anatomical\ndivisions; the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions. About 27 %of human spinal cord\ninjuries are lacerations caused by penetrating objects that tear the spinal tissue (Open", "--- Page 12 ---\n164 Biomaterials Science and Engineering\ninjuries) resulting in a discontinuity of the cord. The majority of the clinical cases are the\nresult of a temporary compression of the cord that leaves the cord surface intact (closed\ninjuries 73%). Three types of compression injuries are described: massive compression,\ncontusion, and solid cord injury (E.Schmidt et al., 2003; Erschbamer, 2007).\nCNS axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment", ". Several glycoproteins\nin the native extracellular environment (myelin) of the CNS are inhibitory for regeneration.\nRegeneration in the adult CNS requires a multi-step process. First, the injured neuron must\nsurvive, and then the damaged axon must extend its cut processes to its original neuronal\ntargets", ". According to Horner and Gage investigation, once contact is made, the axon needs\nto be re-myelinated and functional synapses need to form on the surface of the targeted\nneurons (Horner and Gage., 2000).\nIn addition to the nerve graft and other natural tissues, such as autologous muscle and vein\ngrafts, biopolymers can be a practical tool to provide neurotrophic and/or cellular support\nwhile simultaneously guiding axonal regeneration (Stokols et al., 2004; Rodriguez et al.,\n2000)", ". Indeed, numerous natural and synthetic polymers have been used as scaffolds or\nwithin scaffolds for peripheral and central nerve regeneration.\nFilling of the interior channels with appropriate cell facilitates axon regeneration. The Schwann\ncell (SC) and its basal lamina are crucial components in the environment through which\nregenerating axons grow to reach their peripheral targets", ". They produce myelin, which has\nimportant effects on the speed of transmission of electrical signals and are shown to enhance\nthe regeneration of axons in both the peripheral and central nervous systems (Erschbamer,\n2007; Alovskaya et al., 2007). Therefore, it seems that application of a nerve grafts (scaffolds)\ncoated with SCs can be an appropriate method for spinal cord regeneration.\nConsidering the requirements of scaffolds in general and in particular, i.e. in neural tissue\nengineering, materials appropriate for SC seeding should posse some additional features", ". in neural tissue\nengineering, materials appropriate for SC seeding should posse some additional features. In\norder to successfully design a scaffold that can be used as treatment for SCI, many\nconsiderations must be taken into account. The scaffold should lessen glial scar formation,\nwhile containing sites for cell adhesion to allow regenerating neurons to extend axons into\nthe injury site (Willerth et al., 2007; Radulescu et al., 2007).\nAmong natural materials, Matin in 2004 found that implants coated with collagen are more\nsuccessful than the bare ones. Stokolos et al", ". Stokolos et al. chose to fabricate scaffolds with agarose for\nseveral reasons. First, when implanted into lesion cavities in the spinal cord as an\nunstructured solid agarose hydrogel, it did not evoke an immune or inflammatory response\nand was stable for at least 1 month. Second, it was observed that neither axons nor cells\npenetrated solid agarose hydrogels, which suggested that walls composed of agarose could\neffectively delineate pathways for regenerating axons. Third, freeze-drying could be used to\nfabricate agarose into soft and flexible scaffold", ". Third, freeze-drying could be used to\nfabricate agarose into soft and flexible scaffold. Finally, neurotrophic factors, proven to elicit\nrobust axonal growth could be easily incorporated into these scaffolds.\nIn other researches, Alvskaya et al. described that by using fibronectin as a substrate in an in\nvivo model of spinal cord repair, the growth of neuritis within the material is accompanied\nby migration of SCs into the graft and the presence of reactive astrocytes at its surface\ncontinued", ". Within the first 2 weeks of implantation, a number of cells and cellular elements\nreplaced the FN mat as it dissolved. The first cells to infiltrate FN mats were macrophages.\nThe presence of integrin receptors on Schwann cells may be responsible for the extensive\ninfiltration of Schwann cells. The close spatial correspondence between laminin tubules and\nSchwann cells suggests that they were deposited by the Schwann cells (Alovskaya et al.,\n2007; King et al., 2006).", "--- Page 13 ---\nThe Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 165\nAlong with natural materials, synthetic polymers have been widely used for tissue\nengineering. Recently, Patist et al. demonstrated that the implantation of a macro porous\nPLA tubular scaffold in the transected rat spinal cord elicited a modest axonal regeneration\nresponse", ". These particular scaffolds were prepared by a thermally induced polymer-solvent\nphase separation process and contained longitudinally oriented macropores connected to\neach other by a network of micropores (Patist et al., 2004).\nMoore et al. described multiple-channel, biodegradable scaffolds that serve as the basis for a\nmodel to investigate simultaneously the effects of scaffold architecture, transplanted cells,\nand locally delivered molecular agents on axon regeneration. PLGA with copolymer ratio\n85:15 was used for their experiments", ". PLGA with copolymer ratio\n85:15 was used for their experiments. Primary neonatal Schwann cells were distributed in\nthe channels of the scaffold and remained viable in tissue culture for at least 48 h. Scaffolds\ncontaining SCs implanted into transected adult rat spinal cords contained regenerating\naxons at 1 month post-operation", ". Axon regeneration was demonstrated by three-\ndimensional reconstruction of serial histological sections (Moore et al., 2006).\nAlso it is showed that PGS which have similar in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility to PLGA,\nhad no harmful effect on Schwann cell metabolic activity, attachment, or proliferation, and\ndid not induce apoptosis (Manzanedo, 2005; Sundback et al., 2005).\nPHB has been previously used as a wrap-around implant to guide axonal growth after\nperipheral nerve injury ( Ljungberg et al., 1999). Novikova et al", ". Novikova et al. prepared a biodegradable\nconduit made of PHB fibers which compressed together and running in parallel directions\nin two perpendicular layers to form a sheet. Implantation of these PHB conduits coated with\nalginate hydrogel and fibronectin and seeded with SCs has been found to reduce spinal cord\ncavitation as well as retrograde degeneration of injured spinal tract neurons (Novikov et al.,\n2002).\nPCL is interesting for the preparation of long term implantable devices, owing to its\ndegradation, which is even slower than that of polylactide. Schnell et al", ". Schnell et al. designed\nbiodegradable, aligned poly-e-capro- lactone (PCL) and collagen/PCL (C/PCL) nanofibers\nas guidance structures were produced by electrospinning and tested in cell culture assays.\nThey compared fibers of 100% PCL with fibers consisting of a 25:75% C/PCL blend. Both\ntypes of electrospun fibers supported oriented neurite outgrowth and glial migration from\ndorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants", ". Both\ntypes of electrospun fibers supported oriented neurite outgrowth and glial migration from\ndorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants. SC migration, neurite orientation, and process\nformation of SCs, fibroblasts and olfactory ensheathing cells were improved on C/PCL\nfibers, when compared to pure PCL fibers ( Schnell et al., 2007 ).\nAbout PEG, it was showed that focal continuous application of this polymer has minimal\ntoxicity (Cole and Shi, 2005). Duerstock et al", ". Duerstock et al. used three- dimensional computer reconstructions\nof PEG treated and spinal cords to determine whether the pathological character of a 1- month-\nold injury is ameliorated by application of PEG. In PEG- treated animals, the lesion was more\nfocal and less diffuse throughout the damaged segment of the spinal cord, so that control\ncords showed a significantly extended lesion surface area (Duerstock and Borgens, 2002).\nFurthermore, a pHEMA scaffold could be easily incorporated into the nerve guidance tubes.\nFlynn et al", ". developed a method to create longitude in ally oriented channels within\n(pHEMA) hydrogels for neural tissue engineering applications. They found that these\nscaffolds have the potential to enhance nerve regeneration after section injuries of the spinal\ncord by increasing the available surface area and providing guidance to extending axons\nand invading cells (Flynn et al., 2003).\nSeveral techniques have been developed to process synthetic and natural scaffold materials\ninto porous structures as H. Tabesh et al. reviewed. Among these techniques, creating tissue", "--- Page 14 ---\n166 Biomaterials Science and Engineering\nengineering scaffolds in nano-scale may bring unpredictable new properties to the material-\nsuch as mechanical (stronger), physical (lighter), more porous (tunable),optical (color\nemission), chemical reactivity (more active and less corrosive), electronic properties (more\nelectrically conductive),and magnetic properties (super paramagnetic which are very\nimportant in nerve regeneration)", ". Such scaffolds may come up with new functionalities as\nwell-which are unavailable at micro or macro scales (Tabesh et al., 2009).\nThe process of electrospinning is used for nano-fibrous scaffold fabrication. Electrospinning\ncan even be used to create biocompatible thin films with useful coating designs and surface\nstructures that can be deposited on implantable devices inorder to facilitate the integration\nof these devices with the body", ". Silk-like polymers with fibronectin have been electrospun to\nmake biocompatible films used on prosthetic devices aimed to be implanted in the central\nnervous system (Buchko et al., 1999).\nMoreover, an elegant way to produce nanofibrous scaffold using PLLA by a liquid–liquid\nphase separation method quite similar to natural extracellular matrix (ECM) was developed\nby a group of scientists", ". They showed its efficacy in supporting the neural stem cell (NSC)\ndifferentiation and neurite outgrowth (Yang et al., 2004).\nIn addition, a new and facile method for the creation of longitudinally oriented channels in\npHEMA gels using a fiber templating technique was described. Biodegradable\npolycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were extruded and embedded in transparent pHEMA gels,\nleading to the creation of a pHEMA–PCL composite.\n4", ". Conclusion\nIn this chapter, efficacious biomaterials (natural and synthetic) for scaffolds in tissue\nengineering and cell seeding were discussed and also techniques to their fabrication were\nreviewed. Considering results using such materials and the mentioned criteria for an\nappropriate scaffold, it is proved that the selection of materials and method of fabrication\ndepend on the cells and their characteristics", ". The reasons are: scaffold candidates should\nmimic the structure and biological activity of the native ECM proteins which provide\nadequate mechanical support and regulate cellular activates. In addition, scaffolds must\nsupport and define the three-dimensional structure of the tissue engineered space and\nmaintain the normal state of differentiation within the cellular compartment.\nFurthermore the structure of scaffold, pore size and porosity, may affect the mass transfer,\nshear rate and pressure drop", ". Mass transfer is the major hindrance in tissue engineering.\nAlthough surface area to volume ratios of a scaffold can decrease mass transfer limitations,\nit is still one of the greatest challenge in tissue engineering. It has been observed that the\npore size and shape influence the shear stress level and distribution, while the porosity\naffects only the distribution. Therefore the wall shear stress is an important parameter in cell\nadhesion processes.\nTwo case studies, blood and nerve systems, with regard to their challenges have been\ninvestigated", ". First, for blood system, a scaffold must have the function of native blood and\nmust provide appropriate mechanical, endothelialization and antithrombogenic properties.\nTherefore choosing a proper biomaterial which provides these characters is prominent. With\nrespect to multilayered construction of blood vessels, the combined structure is particularly\nattractive for vascular tissue engineering applications. For a better simulation, various types\nof materials and cells have been used to form different layers of this tissue.", "--- Page 15 ---\nThe Role of Biodegradable Engineered Scaffold in Tissue Engineering 167\nSecondly, for nerve regeneration, it is suggested that blending a synthetic and natural\npolymer (e.g. poly-e-caprolactone and collagen) is the best choice for Schwann cell seeding\nto regenerate the spinal cord injuries, considering all results using different materials and\nthe mentioned criteria for an appropriate scaffold. The two suggested polymers have the\npotential to play role of a scaffold in SCs seeding.\nCollagen is a protein of ECM and exists in the basal membrane of the cell", ". It is easily\npurified, which can be proposed as a proper substance; however, collagen has less strength\nto withstand long time, support force adhesion, and degrades enzymatically within short\nperiods. Therefore, using another polymer such as PCL to enhance the stability and\nmechanical strength of collagen would be crucial. In this sence, an excellent scaffold for\nSchwann cell adhesion, migration, orientation, and proliferation can be provided.\nAlso electrospinning is considered as the excellent method for the fabrication of such\nscaffolds", ". Additionally, electrospun nanofibers exhibit excellent supports for nerve growth\nbecause they can provide large surface area to volume ratios, pore sizes tailored to Schwann\ncells dimensions, functionalized surfaces, and multiple sites for interaction and attachment,\nand low mass transfer limitation.\n5.
