Due to the fast\ndevelopment on biomaterial technologies, it is now possible for\ndoctors to use patients’ cells to repair orthopedic defects such\nas focal articular cartilage lesions", ". In order to support the three-\ndimensional tissue formation, scaff olds made by biocompatible\nand bioresorbable polymers and composite materials, produced\nby three-dimensional (3D) printing, for providing temporary\nsupport to the damaged body and cell structures have been\ndeveloped recently", ". Although ceramic and metallic materials have\nbeen widely accepted for the development of implants, their non-\nresorbability and necessity of second surgical operation result in\nextra discomfort for the patients and limit their wide applications\n[1].\n3D printing is also known as additive manufacturing (AM),\nlayered manufacturing, rapid prototyping (RP), or solid freeform\nfabrication", ". This technique represents the direct fabrication of\nparts layer-by-layer, based on data obtained by computerized\nmedical imaging equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, using a computer-\naided design (CAD) file [2]. In 3D printing, CAD models of the\nparts to be manufactured are first sliced in a virtual environment\nto create a stack of two-dimensional (2D) slices. A 3D printing\nmachine then builds the parts one layer at a time based on the 2D\nslice information, stacking and joining successive layers to make\nthe final 3D object", ". Just as the Internet has given us the ability\nto access information and connect with people from diff erent\nparts of the world, CAD has provided us the ability to create,\nmodify, and, if needed, critique designs in a virtual world. With\nthe advent of 3D printing, such virtual designs can now be\nrendered into physical 3D objects that can serve as prototypes\nor be directly used as functional parts for a variety of\napplications. In this context, polymers in various forms, reactive,\nliquid solutions or as thermoplastic melts play a key role in many", "--- Page 3 ---\nIntroduction 47\napplications and the further expansion toward manufacturing\nrobust, real end use products [3].\nThe origins of contemporary 3D printing can be traced back\nto the 1980s when Hull invented stereolithography (SLA), the\nfirst 3D printing technology [4]. SLA is a process in which an\nultraviolet (UV) laser light source is focused onto the surface of a\nUV-curable liquid monomer bath and scanned in patterns\nrepresenting slice cross sections", ". The scanned monomers undergo\nphoto-induced cross-linking and harden to form the desired\n2D cross sections, while the uncured monomers remain in the\nbath. Hull was also the first to find a way to allow a CAD file to\ncommunicate with the RP system in order to build computer-\nmodeled parts. Hull’s patent was approved in 1986, making it\nthe first patent for a 3D printer. The company 3D Systems,\nfounded by Hull, focused on commercializing SLA systems, which\nwere the first commercial 3D printers [5].\nFast forward to 2014, when the U.S", ". National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration (NASA) launched the first 3D printing\nmachine to the International Space Station to directly build\nparts in space under zero gravity [6]. This is also the year\nwhen researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory built a\ncomplete car body using a 3D printing technique known as big\narea additive manufacturing and partnered with Local Motors\nto commission and drive a functional car at the International\nManufacturing Technology Show [7]", ". 3D printing-based\nagile manufacturing technologies are promoting on-demand\nproduction with traditional as well as innovative designs that\nare difficult, if not impossible, to make through conventional\nmanufacturing (CM) approaches", ". 3D printing technologies\nare also making a significant impact in biomedical research—\nfrom device designs to tissue engineering (TE) to bioprinting and\ndrug delivery.\nAfter following the technology, markets, and publications\nover several years, it appears that now we are in a period where\nmany decisive actors in industry, media, and research and even\nfinance advisors realize that the traditional area of prototyping\nis expanding more and more into manufacturing, and this will\nhave a significant impact on many areas of our lives, and probably", "is expanding more and more into manufacturing, and this will\nhave a significant impact on many areas of our lives, and probably\na spectacular growth of the 3D printing industry [3].", "--- Page 4 ---\n48 3D Printing of Biopolymers\n3.2 Brief History of 3D Printing\nSeveral 3D printing technologies were conceived and developed\naround the time of the emergence of SLA. Deckard invented\nselective laser sintering (SLS) as a graduate student in Beaman’s\ngroup at the University of Texas at Austin [8]. SLS uses powder\nmaterials spread on a build plate where a laser selectively\nsinters the powder in certain areas based on the CAD file [6]", ". SLS uses powder\nmaterials spread on a build plate where a laser selectively\nsinters the powder in certain areas based on the CAD file [6]. A\nsimilar powder bed-based concept formed the basis of another\ntechnology, 3D printing, at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology by Sachs’ group. Inkjet printing was combined with\na powder bed, where a binder was printed onto each successive\nlayer of swept powder based on the CAD slice information.\nUsing this approach, complex shaped metal, polymer, and ceramic\nparts could be printed", ". However, post-processing or sintering\nsteps were often required to enhance the final strength of the\nparts [9]. Scott and Lisa Crump developed another 3D printing\ntechnology called fused deposition modeling (FDM). FDM\ninvolves heating a thermoplastic filament to a semi-liquid state,\nwhich is then extruded and deposited through a nozzle onto\na substrate to build parts layer-by-layer based on the CAD file\ninformation [10, 11]. Additionally, Sanders released the first\n3D printer based on inkjet printing of thermoplastic polymers\n[12]", ". Additionally, Sanders released the first\n3D printer based on inkjet printing of thermoplastic polymers\n[12]. Parts with fine features could be made easily using this\napproach. These are some of the notable early-stage 3D\nprinting technologies that were primarily focused on RP for design\nverification and visualization.\nOver the past 15 years, a variety of new technologies have\nevolved that have transformed the idea of RP to AM, where parts\nproduced by a 3D printer can be directly used for a variety of\napplications", ". In the case of metallic materials, laser-based or\nelectron beam-based technologies with or without a powder\nbed have truly revolutionized industrial applications of these\nprinters. For biomedical applications, novel fabrication\napproaches based on the 3D-Bioplotter or direct ink writing,\nlaser-assisted bioprinting, and robotic-assisted printing are all\nin use for diff erent applications.

This method was originally\ncoined with the name “3D printing” by the MIT, but is now used\nalongside the other techniques with the same designation.\nIf we look at the second group of technologies where we\nuse addition of the material for each full cross section, without\na separate imaging step, we have two major processes, which\ndominate the market by machine numbers: (Multi)jet printing\nof reactive resins or molten wax (ASTM: Material Jetting) and\nextrusion of molten thermoplastics (ASTM: Material Extrusion).\nThe processes coined as Multijet Modelling or Polyjet use a", "extrusion of molten thermoplastics (ASTM: Material Extrusion).\nThe processes coined as Multijet Modelling or Polyjet use a\nprint head similar to inkjet printers to deposit exactly shaped\nlayers of a photopolymer resin, and normally a support material\nto partially surround it, which is then immediately cured with a UV\nlamp", ".

This heating is also\nrequired in machines, which are processing wax materials to\nproduce patterns for investment casting, in jewelry and dental\nrestorations applications notably.\nA recent development adds machines with multiple print\nheads or channels, again similar to color inkjet printers, which\ncan deposit selected mixtures of diff erent materials.

It is another step to replace assemblies of several\ncomponents and fasteners with a single part, which is generally\nan advantage of additive technologies.\nThe last technique we look at is based on the original\nprocess of FDM and also relies on a rather simple buildup of an\nessentially standard thermoplastic material (ASTM: Material\nExtrusion).

Other than biopolymers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),\npoly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly-\nL-lactide acid (PLLA) are the widely used synthetic polymers in\nthe biomedical field [29].\nHowever, not all polymeric materials are applicable and\nsuitable for all manufacturing methods. For example, molding\nmethods are inappropriate for developing medical implants from", "--- Page 15 ---\nBiopolymers Used for 3D Printing 59\nhydrogels. Because, the biomaterial cannot be removed without\ndamaging both internal and external architecture, which will\nmost likely cause the implant breakage [29].\nAnother factor to consider is the degradation rate of the\nbiomaterial, since it is desired that the material degrade once its\nfunction is accomplished, which would avoid a second operation\non the individuals to remove the implant. In this context, the\nbiodegradation rate of PLLA is too low to match the tissue\nregeneration process after implantation", ". In this context, the\nbiodegradation rate of PLLA is too low to match the tissue\nregeneration process after implantation. Besides, the acidic\ndegradation products of PLLA, such as lactic acid, tend to cause\naseptic inflammation in tissue [29]. On the contrary, PCL has the\npresence of hydrolytic aliphatic–ester bonds, which are unstable.\nTherefore, its degradation duration can be as long as 24 months\nfor being completely degraded. Thus, PCL is always used to co-\npolymerize with other materials to have desired degradation\nproperties [1]", ". Thus, PCL is always used to co-\npolymerize with other materials to have desired degradation\nproperties [1]. So, PCL has a better degradation rate to make\nlong-term implants and controlled-drug-release implants. In this\nsense, Honda et al. [30] used poly(L-lactide-ε-caprolactone) as a\nbiodegradable sponge and implanted it into a nude mice", ". In this\nsense, Honda et al. [30] used poly(L-lactide-ε-caprolactone) as a\nbiodegradable sponge and implanted it into a nude mice. After a\n4-week experimental process, the result showed that there was\nthe formation of cartilage-like structures in the construct [1].\nAdditionally, polymers can be chemically modified to match\nthe rate of tissue regeneration and degradation rate of the\nmaterial as well as to obtain a wide range of properties for\nbiomedical applications, such as mechanical properties, diff usivity,\ndensity, and hydrophilicity", ". In addition, these may have optimal\ncontrol over specific cellular interactions with the polymer\nmaterial, whereby cells are comfortable, interacting with\nproteins that bind to the surface of the material, particularly\nbiopolymers [29].\nOn the other hand, the combination of more than one\nbiomaterial provides better characteristics than any single type\nof biomaterial, which in turn leads to the development of\ncomposite polymeric materials [29]", ". In this context, composite\npolymers as 3D printing materials have been used to improve\nimplant–tissue biocompatibility, i.e., they will not be rejected by\nthe body upon implantation [2]. For example, Inzana et al. [31]\ndeveloped osseous implants from polymer blends of collagen\nand Tween 80 using calcium phosphate as a natural filler with", "--- Page 16 ---\n60 3D Printing of Biopolymers\nthe aim of improving osteointegration and improving the\nmechanical properties of the implant [31]. However, the\ndevelopment of these materials requires high temperatures\nthat prevent the incorporation of bioactive molecules and drugs\nduring the 3D printing process, which could stimulate bone\nregeneration or combat infections [31].\nThe feasibility of 3D printing of composite biopolymers at\nlow temperature has also been demonstrated from low-melting-\npoint matrices [2, 31]", ". This has allowed the incorporation of drugs,\ncells, and 3D printing of synthetic or biological polymers such as\ncollagen, thus allowing the development of bioactive implants\n[2]. Type I collagen is the most abundant structural protein in the\nhuman body and is a critical component of bone extracellular\nmatrix, where it plays important roles in this mineralized tissue’s\nstrength and toughness. It has been shown that incorporating\ncollagen into mineralized bone cements could enhance their\nbiomechanical properties, as well as their osteoconductive and\nosteoinductive characteristics", ". For example, collagen incorporation\ninto hand-mixed calcium phosphate cements has been shown to\nimprove cellular attachment, viability, proliferation, and activity\nas well as mechanical properties", ". Advantages of 3D printing over\nmolding or paste injection include patient-specific geometries\nand controlled spatial patterning of drugs or polymers within the\nscaff old [31].\n3.5 Advantages of 3D Printing for Medical\nApplications\n3D printing technology off ers significant advantages for medical\napplications due to the ability to manufacture low-volume or\none-of-a-kind parts on-demand based on patient-specific needs.\nFor example, surgical implants are currently manufactured by\nmaking a near-net-shape part via forging, casting, or machining", "For example, surgical implants are currently manufactured by\nmaking a near-net-shape part via forging, casting, or machining\noperations, followed by specialized surface finishing or treatments\nfor the desired surface, mechanical properties, and aesthetic\neff ects, as shown in Fig", ". 3.2. These operations require expensive\ntooling; therefore, patient-specific or one-of-a-kind implants are\ncostly and are rarely used. Other challenges such as difficulty in\nmachining of titanium alloys due to high strength, low modulus of", "--- Page 17 ---\nAdvantages of 3D Printing for Medical Applications 61\nelasticity, and low thermal conductivity compared with steel\nmakes it more expensive to manufacture patient-specific\nimplants from these materials [32]. Finally, CM technologies can\nbe energy intensive, producing significant amounts of material\nwaste, and are not capable of easily producing implants with\nfunctional gradation.\n3D printing or AM represents a new option for the\nproduction of a variety of biomedical devices such as orthopedic\nimplants", ". Although AM may require final machining, the AM-\nbased approach allows significant flexibility toward manufacturing\ncustomized, low-volume, complex implants. Figure 3.2 compares\nCM of implants with AM. AM provides geometrical freedom to\ndesigners without manufacturing constraints, leading to novel\nlightweight designs and potentially reduced part counts for\nmedical implants. Specifically for medical implants, AM allows for\ncustomized complex shaped functional implants and demand-\nbased manufacturing—which can off er a significant reduction in\ncost and inventory", ". Since AM does not require any part specific\ntooling, cost per part remains constant for AM. However, for\nCM, there is always a fixed cost for tooling and dies, and therefore,\ncost per part decreases as the volume of parts increases until\nit reaches a minimum. Such cost analysis forms the basis and\nrationale for the use of 3D printing or AM for biomedical devices.\nDespite some noteworthy success, the construction of human\ntissue or entire organs with 3D printing or AM continues to present\nsignificant challenges [33–36]", ". From plastic surgery to cancer\ntreatment and from treatment of birth defects to prosthetics\nfor amputees—all areas of medicine are seeking breakthroughs\nenabled by 3D printing to enhance quality of life or to help patients\nlive longer.\nWe present two examples that illustrate future possibilities.\nComplex craniofacial titanium implants from computed tomography\nimages of a fractured skull, shown in Fig. 3.3, can be fabricated\ndirectly using a laser-based AM technology, Laser Engineered\nNet Shaping. In another example, shown in Fig", ". 3.3, can be fabricated\ndirectly using a laser-based AM technology, Laser Engineered\nNet Shaping. In another example, shown in Fig. 3.4, TE scaff olds\nfor bone regeneration can be produced through SLS of\npoly(caprolactone), a biocompatible and bioresorbable polymer,\nand poly(caprolactone)–hydroxyapatite composites [37, 38].\nFurthermore, the scaff olds can be produced with a priori\ndesigned mechanical properties to match the desired mechanical\nperformance of the target bone tissue.", "--- Page 18 ---\n62 3D Printing of

The user must know what material will be used and\nwhat kind of resolution is needed before selecting a 3D printer.\nThis limitation is the main reason why diff erent companies have\nmultiple 3D printers for a variety of applications.\n3.6.5 Future Trends\n3D printing of multi-material structures is one of the most\npromising future trends. Diff erent materials at diff erent locations\nin a structure can off er properties that cannot be achieved using\nmonolithic structures", ". Diff erent materials at diff erent locations\nin a structure can off er properties that cannot be achieved using\nmonolithic structures. These materials can only be bonded to\neach other or alloyed during the part building, allowing for\ncompositional variations in the part. For 3D-printed biomaterials,\na simple example can help us understand the power of multi-\nmaterial 3D printing. For total hip prosthesis, implants are made\nwith either Ti Al V or CoCrMo alloys. To enhance bone–tissue\n6 4\nintegration, implants are sometimes coated with porous Ti or Ta\nmetal or calcium phosphate-based ceramics", ". To enhance bone–tissue\n6 4\nintegration, implants are sometimes coated with porous Ti or Ta\nmetal or calcium phosphate-based ceramics. However, diff erent\nprocessing strategies are utilized for the addition of coatings.\nUsing multi-material 3D printing, a calcium phosphate or metal\ncoated hip stem can be directly manufactured from the same\nmachine that can also produce an uncoated sample in the very next\nrun", ". Therefore, in addition to flexibility in design modifications,\nthe potential of incorporating compositional variations will allow\nfuture innovations in advanced materials and structures using\n3D printing.\nFor bioprinting, multi-material structures include cells that\ncan be printed along with organic or inorganic materials to\nmake a fully functional scaff old for TE [39]. Such an approach is\ngaining considerable attention from a number of researchers,\nthough there are many challenges that need careful attention.\nFor example, cell viability will be key for successful bioprinting\noperation", ". Shelf-life of materials with and without cells is\nanother significant issue. Also, due to significant variation in the\nstiff ness of the cells and materials to be deposited, careful process\noptimization is necessary to build scaff olds that can be used for\nfurther in vitro or in vivo analysis.", "--- Page 24 ---\n68 3D Printing of Biopolymers\nAnother important criterion is vascularization or new blood\nvessel network formation, commonly known as angiogenesis.\nFigure 3.5 shows new blood vessel formation in 3D-printed-doped\ntricalcium phosphate TE scaff olds in a rat distal femur model.\n3D-printed TE scaff olds should support angiogenesis for\nfunctional tissue formation to enhance healing in vivo [40–46].\nFigure 3.5 New blood vessel formation in 3D-printed-doped tricalcium\nphosphate TE scaff olds implanted in a rat distal femur model.", "Figure 3.5 New blood vessel formation in 3D-printed-doped tricalcium\nphosphate TE scaff olds implanted in a rat distal femur model.\nFinally, 3D printing combined with drug or protein delivery\nis becoming popular and is expected to gain more attention in\nthe future", ". Drug-/protein-loaded biomaterials with a controlled\ndelivery option can be used to treat many diseases [45]", ". In particular,\nspecific drug combinations that are patient-matched and unique\ncan be loaded into a single 3D-printed drug delivery device.\nHowever, drug–material and drug–drug interactions during 3D\nprinting are complex topics and will require significant process\noptimization before actual applications can be realized and\napproved for patient use.\n3.7 Conclusion\nThe processing of biopolymers and polymer composites through\nthree-dimensional (3D) printing has been gaining a lot of\nattention, because of its multiple applications in a wide variety", "--- Page 25 ---\nReferences 69\nof industries. In fact, the exploration of the areas of applicability\nof this technique remains an active area of research. With the\nlatest 3D printers capable of printing materials with a widely\ncontrasting mechanical behavior and with complex geometries\nat micrometer resolutions, the potential of this technology\nhas grown", ". This technology now off ers the possibility of creating\ncomplex topologies with fine features, composed of a multitude\nof materials with variable mechanical properties on a large\nscale, thus allowing the manufacture of devices with an\nunprecedented multifunctional performance [47, 48]", ". Particularly\nin medical applications, in the last decade there has been a growing\ninterest in the development of medical systems with bioactive\nproperties, which have been possible thanks to the technological\ndevelopment of 3D printing as well as biopolymers, drugs,\nnatural fillers and implementation in vitro or in vivo of cells in\nthe formulated materials, which have generated a series of\nimplants with outstanding mechanical properties and exceptional\nbiocompatibility, adjusted to the exact dimensions of each implant\nfor each patient", ". Likewise, because of the greater surface area\nof these devices, the cells are able to regenerate the tissues at\na faster rate, thus allowing the patients to recover quickly, and\navoiding a subsequent operation to remove the implant, since\nthese implants are degraded in the time, while this one fulfills\nthe mission for which it was developed", ". Finally, this type of\nimplant also promises to be a controlled-drug-release device,\nwhile the polymer material used is degraded.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones\nCientíficas y Técnicas (CONICET) (Postdoctoral fellowship\ninternal PDTS-Resolution 2417) and Universidad Nacional de\nMar del Plata (UNMdP) for the financial support, and to Dr. Mirian\nCarmona-Rodríguez.\nReferences\n1.
