1.4.3.1.2 Conductometric Biosensors
Conductometry is the measure of the ability of ions in solu-
tion to carry current between two inert electrodes under an
applied electric field. The ions are formed by the dissocia-
tion of the electrolyte. On the application of a potential dif-
ference between the two electrodes, a chaotic ion movement
occurs, where anions move toward anodes, while cations
move toward cathodes in the electrolytic cells (Figure 1.4).
The conductivity (S) of the electrolyte solution depends
on the ion concentration and mobility. The resistance of
electrolyte solution is in direct proportion to the distance
L between the immersed electrodes and reciprocal to their
area A; therefore, conductivity (S) can be calculated using FIGURE 1.4 Ion migration in solution under an applied potential
