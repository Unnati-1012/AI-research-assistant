Instead, the alloy is cast by a lost wax (or investment casting)\nmethod which involves making a wax pattern of the desired component. The pattern is coated with a\nrefractory material, first by a thin coating with a slurry (suspension of silica in ethyl silicate solution)\nfollowed by complete investing after drying: (1) the wax is then melted out in a furnace (100~150°C),", "followed by complete investing after drying: (1) the wax is then melted out in a furnace (100~150°C),\n(2) the mold is heated to a high temperature burning out any traces of wax or gas-forming materials,\n(3) molten alloy is poured with gravitational or centrifugal force, and (4) the mold is broken after cooled.\nThe mold temperature is about 800~1000°C and the alloy is at 1350~1400°C.\nControlling the mold temperature will have an effect on the grain size of the final cast; coarse ones\nformed at higher temperatures will decrease the strength. However, a high processing temperature will", "formed at higher temperatures will decrease the strength. However, a high processing temperature will\nresult in larger carbide precipitates with greater distances between them, resulting in a less brittle material.\nAgain there is a complementary (trade-off) relationship between strength and toughness.\nTi and Its Alloys\nTitanium is very reactive at high temperature and burns readily in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, it\nrequires an inert atmosphere for high temperature processing or is processed by vacuum melting. Oxygen", "requires an inert atmosphere for high temperature processing or is processed by vacuum melting. Oxygen\ndiffuses readily in titanium and the dissolved oxygen embrittles the metal. As a result, any hot-working or\nforging operation should be carried out below 925°C.
