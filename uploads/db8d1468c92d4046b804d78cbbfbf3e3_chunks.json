["--- Page 1 ---\nOrganisms must constantly protect themselves from harm caused by invaders such as bacterial and\nviral pathogens. The immune system delivers this protection via numerous pathways, but this can\nbroadly be broken down into two arms, innate immunity and adaptive immunity.\nImmunity definition\nImmunity is defined as an organism’s ability to protect itself from anything it does not recognize\nas self, such as a pathogen or toxin.\nHow does the immune system tell self from non-self?\nIn humans, all nucleated cells express distinctive surface molecules called major", "How does the immune system tell self from non-self?\nIn humans, all nucleated cells express distinctive surface molecules called major\nhistocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) that identify them as being self. Anything that\ndoes not possess these “self-tags” may be recognized by the immune system as foreign and\ntargeted. Anything that triggers the immune system is called an antigen.\nWhat is innate immunity?\nInnate immunity, also known as genetic or natural immunity, is immunity that an organism is born", "What is innate immunity?\nInnate immunity, also known as genetic or natural immunity, is immunity that an organism is born\nwith. This type of immunity is written in one’s genes, offering lifelong protection. It is considered\nthe more evolutionarily primitive immune system and consequently, as well as being found in\nvertebrates, is also found in various shapes and forms in plants, fungi and insects. The innate\nimmune response is fast-acting and non-specific, meaning it does not respond differently based on\nthe specific invader that it detects.", "immune response is fast-acting and non-specific, meaning it does not respond differently based on\nthe specific invader that it detects.\nIn humans, the innate immune system encompasses physical and chemical barriers, that provide a\nfirst line of defense, and chemical (humoral) and cellular aspects as the second line of defense.\n• Physical and chemical barriers protect the body from invasion and include things like\nthe skin and eyelashes, while substances at these barriers, such as tears, mucous, blood\nclotting factors and stomach acid help to stop and destroy them.", "clotting factors and stomach acid help to stop and destroy them.\n• Chemical defenses consist of proteins able to interact directly or indirectly with invaders,\nactivating cascades of reactions to cause inflammation and recruit further immune\nmediators that help to defend the body. Examples include the complement system,\ninterferons and interleukin-1.\n• Cellular defenses identify things that are non-self, take steps to neutralize or destroy them\nand activate the adaptive immune system. Examples include phagocytes, natural killer cells\nand mast cells.", "and activate the adaptive immune system. Examples include phagocytes, natural killer cells\nand mast cells.\nThe path taken will depend upon whether the threat is intracellular, such as a virus,\nor extracellular, such as a bacterium. Invaders may be recognized by the innate immune system\nif the host MHC-class I molecules that indicate it as self are absent, as is the case with natural\nkiller cell surveillance. Alternatively, molecules may be recognized that are common to many\npathogens but are absent in the host. These are called pathogen-associated molecular", "--- Page 2 ---\npatterns or PAMPs, and their recognition promotes their destruction through phagocytosis or\ncytotoxic killing.\nFor intracellular threats, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect non-self-components, such\nas viral RNA, DNA, or intermediate products. This leads to the production of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines, induces apoptosis of infected cells or flags them to be targeted by other innate immune\ncells for destruction.\nPhagocytic cells, such as dendritic cells, are able to chop up the foreign material they engulf and", "cells for destruction.\nPhagocytic cells, such as dendritic cells, are able to chop up the foreign material they engulf and\npresent it on their surfaces which is an important step in activating the adaptive immune response.\nThis has earned them the name, antigen-presenting cells (APCs).\nCollectively, the main roles of the innate immune system are to:\n1. Prevent the entry of foreign material using physical and chemical barriers.\n2. Prevent further spread of infection through humoral mediators such as the complement\ncascade.", "2. Prevent further spread of infection through humoral mediators such as the complement\ncascade.\n3. Remove non-self via phagocytosis (e.g., macrophages or neutrophils) or cytotoxic means.\n4. Activate the adaptive immune system through signaling cytokines and antigen\npresentation.", "--- Page 3 ---\nWhat is adaptive immunity?\nOrganisms are not born with adaptive immunity and it is not “hard-wired” in their genes like innate\nimmunity. It is acquired during their lifetime as a result of exposure to specific antigens, be that\nthrough natural means such as infection or by vaccination. Consequently, it is also known as\nacquired immunity. An adaptive immune response is much slower than an innate response, taking\ndays or even weeks to develop on first encounter (the primary immune response), but is specific", "days or even weeks to develop on first encounter (the primary immune response), but is specific\nto the antigen(s) present and can retain a long-term “memory” to enable a faster response if it is\nencountered again in the future. Adaptive immunity does it necessarily last throughout an\norganism’s entire lifespan, especially if it is not regularly re-exposed, although it can.\nIf the innate immune system alone is insufficient to control a foreign threat, the adaptive immune\nsystem is activated via signaling molecules and/or the presentation of antigens by antigen-", "system is activated via signaling molecules and/or the presentation of antigens by antigen-\npresenting cells. Professional antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, have major\nhistocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) molecules on their surface that are involved\nin the presentation of foreign peptides, helping to ensure appropriate immune activation. The\nadaptive response consists of the cell-mediated immune response, which is executed by T cells,\nand the humoral immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies.", "and the humoral immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies.\nClonal expansion of T and B cells that specifically recognize epitopes of the antigens present\noccurs.\nT-cells have diverse functions and may cause direct killing of infected cells or help to stimulate B\ncells towards antibody production. Once stimulated, naïve B cells differentiate into memory cells\nand plasma cells. Plasma cells produce and secrete large quantities of antigen-specific antibodies\nfor the remainder of their lifecycle to help neutralize and destroy their target. Memory cells can", "for the remainder of their lifecycle to help neutralize and destroy their target. Memory cells can\nsurvive for decades, reactivating in response to the presence of their target antigen to produce\nantibodies. Consequently, the response to repeated exposures may be faster and more robust.\nThe above description of adaptive immunity describes active immunity, which is the result of first-\nhand exposure, infection, or vaccination. Passive immunity.is also a type of adaptive immunity but\ninstead of creating its own antibodies, the organism receives external antibodies that help to protect", "instead of creating its own antibodies, the organism receives external antibodies that help to protect\nthem.
